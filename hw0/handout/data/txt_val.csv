"Japan police arrest a knife-wielding woman inside a train after 4 people are reported injured.

Police arrested a woman who wielded a knife and injured four passengers inside a train that stopped at Tokyo’s electronic town of Akihabara late Wednesday, Japanese media reported.

Police rushed to the scene after a report that a woman was brandishing a knife while the train stopped at the Akihabara station, where four people were injured and taken to a hospital, NHK public television reported.

Police arrested the attacker, identified only as a woman in her 20s, on suspicion of attempted murder, Kyodo News reported. It said at least three men who were stabbed were taken to hospitals.

No other details, including the condition of the injured and a motive for the attack, were available. Police declined to confirm the media reports.

Violent crimes are rare in Japan, which has strict gun control laws and only a handful of gun-related crimes annually. But in recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving random knife attacks and arson on subways, and there is growing concern about homemade guns and explosives.

Akihabara is the site of a 2008 vehicle crash and stabbing rampage in which the attacker killed seven people and injured 10 others. He was sentenced to death and executed last year.

Train operators in major cities have been stepping up safety measures, including installing security cameras on train cars and conducting more frequent drills among station staff.",https://apnews.com/article/japan-akihabara-stabbing-train-16446013935787332e36186aaa8d4812,real,0
"Japan police arrest a knife-wielding woman inside a train after 4 people are reported injured.

In a harrowing incident that unfolded within the confines of a train in Japan, law enforcement swiftly responded to a distress call, apprehending a knife-wielding woman after four individuals were reported injured during the unsettling ordeal.

The incident occurred during a routine train journey, turning a typical commute into a scene of chaos and panic. Witnesses described a sudden and unexpected escalation, as the assailant, identified as a woman wielding a knife, began to indiscriminately target passengers on board.

Authorities were immediately notified, and a swift response from Japan's police forces ensued. As the train was brought to a halt, law enforcement officers rushed to the scene, working diligently to ensure the safety of passengers and subdue the suspect.

Reports indicate that four people sustained injuries during the chaotic episode, prompting an urgent and coordinated effort from emergency services. The injured individuals were quickly transported to nearby medical facilities for treatment, with their conditions currently under assessment.

The motives behind the attack remain unclear, as investigators work diligently to piece together the events leading up to the violent incident. Preliminary findings suggest that the suspect acted alone, and there is no indication of a broader threat to public safety.

Eyewitnesses on the scene recount moments of fear and confusion as the situation unfolded. Passengers and railway staff demonstrated resilience and quick thinking, assisting those in need and cooperating with authorities during the response efforts.

Japan's law enforcement agencies are conducting a thorough investigation into the incident, working to determine the motive, background, and any potential connections the suspect may have had. Security measures within the country's public transportation system are also likely to come under scrutiny as authorities seek ways to enhance passenger safety.

The incident serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges faced by societies in maintaining public safety and security, even in seemingly routine environments.

"Athena Cinema reopens after eight-month closure.

The Athena Cinema, located at 20 S. Court St., reopened one of its three theater screens after an eight-month closure Friday. 

The cinema was fully closed from the end of May 2023 through Jan. 5, 2024, for structural repairs, Alexandra Kamody, director of the Athena Cinema, said. 

“We needed to make some structural repairs to the building,” she said. “The university discovered that some repairs needed to be made, and they made the decision to close down the theater during the repairs.”

While the Athena Cinema’s building was closed, it still held several events, including movie screenings on the roof of the Athens Parking Garage – 7 E. Washington St. – and screenings at the Ridges, which brought many Athens residents together to watch movies. 

“During our closure period ... we had hundreds of people come up to the Ridges to watch our Appalachian film series,“ Kamody said.

Many students were disappointed by the theater’s closure, such as Mia Walsh, a senior studying women’s, gender and sexuality studies. She said she was shocked and sad to see the Athena on Court Street close. 

Walsh said she and her friends don’t have cars with them on campus, so it added difficulties for them when trying to figure out how to go to another nearby theater, like the Athena Grand, located at 1008 E. State St. Before, she said she could walk to the Athena Cinema and easily access the theater. 

Although Walsh was disappointed to see the building closed, she was excited to participate in some of the events put on by the theater. 

“(The Athena is) just a staple of the community, and so it was just sad to see that it was closed for a little bit,” she said. “Then I got really happy, of course, when I saw that they were doing the rooftop events, especially over the summer.”

The closure was also difficult for the cinema’s employees, Kamody said, because they were just starting to regain momentum within the cinema after the theater was closed for 16 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“It wasn't easy to pivot and shift gears when we found out that we would need to be closed for several months,"" she said. “I think that the community support has been a huge motivator for us. And also, we just have a really creative team here that's willing to try different things.”

Although the cinema currently only has one screen open, Kamody said she believes this will not limit attendance at the theater. 

However, those who wish to once again support the theater will have to wait a bit longer to enjoy the cinema in its fullest form due to the renovations. There’s still a limited amount of programs shown at the theater, which has become a concern for Kamody.

“I think it's challenging as a programmer because we can't fit nearly as much programming in as we could when we have three screens,” she said. “This is a really busy time in the film industry. Due to the writer’s strike, a lot of films are coming out a little bit later.”

Walsh said she’ll be back at the Athena Cinema soon, and encouraged other students to enjoy what it has to offer.  

“I think students should take advantage and support the small business and see independent films,” she said.

Although the closure was a challenge for the cinema’s staff, Kamody said they are ready to get back into the building and start showing movies to its part of the community again.

“I think we all just are really excited to get back to doing what we do, which is play movies,” she said. “We want to do that regularly in our building.”

According to Athena’s Instagram, the two downstairs theaters are anticipated to reopen within the coming months. ",https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2024/01/athena-cinema-reopen-closed-renovation-theater-screening-ohio-university,real,0
"Athena Cinema reopens after eight-month closure.

Rejoice, cinephiles! The iconic Athena Cinema, a beloved Athens, Ohio institution, has finally reopened its doors after a lengthy eight-month closure. Moviegoers can once again step into the historic theater's velvet-lined halls and lose themselves in the magic of the silver screen.

The closure, which began in May 2023, was necessary to address some much-needed structural repairs to the building. Originally constructed in 1915, the Athena has weathered decades of cinematic adventures, and the renovations were crucial to ensure its continued legacy for generations to come.

“The Athena is more than just a movie theater,” said Alexandra Kamody, director of the cinema. “It’s a community hub, a gathering place for friends and families to share stories and experiences. We’re thrilled to welcome everyone back and create new memories together.”

The reopening wasn't without its challenges. The closure coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting additional hurdles for the already struggling arts community. However, the Athena persevered, thanks to the unwavering support of its dedicated patrons and a successful fundraising campaign.

“The outpouring of love and support from the community has been truly heartwarming,” Kamody said. “It gave us the strength and determination to see this project through.”

The grand reopening on January 5th, 2024, was a joyous occasion. Moviegoers eagerly lined up, eager to reclaim their cherished cinematic haven. The first film screened was the Oscar-nominated drama ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" a fitting choice for a theater experiencing its own triumphant comeback.

The reopening marks a new chapter for the Athena Cinema. The theater has not only regained its structural integrity but also embraced a renewed sense of purpose. Plans are underway to host community events, educational programs, and even live music performances in addition to the regular lineup of independent and arthouse films.

“We want the Athena to be more than just a place to watch movies,” Kamody said. “We want it to be a vibrant cultural center where people can connect, learn, and be inspired.”

So, gather your popcorn and dust off your movie tickets, Athens. The Athena Cinema is back, and the silver screen is calling.","Can you write me a news article where the title is ""Athena Cinema reopens after eight-month closure""",fake,1
"Bensalem Letter Carrier Honored For 43-Year Career.

BENSALEM TOWNSHIP, PA —He was her mailman for 30 years.

Every day, Debbie McBreen would see the man ""who always had a smile on his face"" —U.S. Postal Service letter carrier Kyle Livesay.

""He was amazing, so friendly. He is just a wonderful person and an excellent man,"" said McBreen, the township government's administrative assistant and council clerk.

"Israel says it uncovered Hamas terror network planning attacks in Europe.

Hamas runs a network of operatives in Europe commanded by terror leaders in Lebanon, Israel said Saturday as its intelligence agencies released new details on the Gaza-based organization’s attempts to attack Israeli and Jewish targets abroad.

Most of the group’s Lebanon-based commanders, including Saleh al-Arouri and Khalil Harraz, were killed in airstrikes in recent weeks attributed to Israel, as Jerusalem pursues Hamas in Gaza and beyond.

Hamas cells in Denmark, Germany and Holland were arrested in December on suspicion of plotting to attack Jewish targets in Europe.

According to a statement released Saturday by the Prime Minister’s Office, Israel’s Mossad and Shin Bet agencies in cooperation with foreign partners have been able to build a “comprehensive and in-depth” picture of Hamas’s efforts to carry out attacks in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

The PMO said Israel has uncovered “details on theaters of operation, terror targets, and on those involved in carrying out attacks — from Hamas commanders in Lebanon to the last of the attackers in the operational infrastructure.”

It did not provide many further details on these findings, but said the network had been planning to attack Israel’s embassy in Sweden, buy UAVs and utilize criminal organizations in Europe to support attacks.

Arouri, wanted for years by Israel and seen as the prime orchestrator of Hamas’s West Bank terrorism, was killed earlier this month in a strike in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast was carried out by an Israeli drone.

Israeli officials declined to comment. Unnamed US officials told The New York Times and Washington Post that Israel was responsible.

Israel has vowed to target all leaders of Hamas after the terror group’s devastating October 7 attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw the abduction of over 240 others.

In late October, in response to the massacres, Israel launched a large-scale offensive in the Gaza Strip with the stated goal of destroying Hamas. The fighting is ongoing, with the Strip’s north largely under Israeli control, while intensive battles continue in the south and center.

Harraz, deputy commander of Hamas’s military wing in Lebanon, was killed in a November strike in Lebanon also attributed to Israel.

On Friday, Danish police said that seven people suspected of involvement in a planned terror attack foiled by authorities in December had links to Hamas. Police said on December 14 that they had arrested three people in Denmark suspected of planning a “terror” attack, but provided no other details.

The prosecutor’s statement appeared to back up comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said on December 14 that Denmark’s security forces had “thwarted an attack, the goal of which was to kill innocent civilians on European soil.

“The Hamas terrorist organization has been working relentlessly and exhaustively to expand its lethal operations to Europe, and thereby constitutes a threat to the domestic security of these countries,” Netanyahu said then of the apparent plot against Jewish or Israeli targets.

Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said Friday that the alleged connection to Hamas “confirms that the threat against Denmark is serious, but luckily we have a strong police and intelligence service doing their best to protect us every day.”

In December, Israel updated travel warnings for dozens of countries, amid rising antisemitism and threats of violence against Israelis and Jews around the world as its war against Hamas in Gaza continues, sparked by the terror group’s October 7 massacres.

"Israel says it uncovered Hamas terror network planning attacks in Europe.

In a significant development, Israeli security forces have disclosed the uncovering of a Hamas terror network with alleged plans to carry out attacks in Europe. The revelation underscores the global reach of the militant group, raising concerns about potential threats beyond the Middle East.

Israeli intelligence, in a press briefing, detailed the extensive operation that led to the discovery of the Hamas network. The group is said to have been actively plotting and coordinating terrorist activities on European soil. While specific targets and timelines were not disclosed, authorities stressed the severity of the threat posed by this transnational terror network.

The revelation has prompted heightened security measures across European capitals, with intelligence agencies cooperating closely to assess the credibility of the information provided by Israel. Governments are on high alert as they work to ensure the safety of their citizens and prevent any potential attacks.

Hamas, designated as a terrorist organization by several countries and entities, has a history of orchestrating attacks against Israeli targets. The group's expansion of its activities to Europe poses a new challenge for counterterrorism efforts, requiring increased international cooperation to address the evolving threat landscape.

Israel has called for a united front against terrorism, urging European nations to strengthen their collaboration on intelligence-sharing and security measures. The disclosure of the Hamas network's plans serves as a stark reminder of the global nature of terrorism and the necessity for coordinated efforts to counteract such threats on an international scale.","generate a news article that best describes the title, ""Israel says it uncovered Hamas terror network planning attacks in Europe""",fake,1

"US House passes two Taiwan-focused bills.

The US House of Representatives on Friday passed the Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act of 2023 and the Pressure Regulatory Organizations To End Chinese Threats to Taiwan (PROTECT) Act, aimed at countering China’s efforts to exclude the nation from participating in international financial institutions.

The House Financial Services Committee said in a statement that the non-discrimination a, sponsored by US Representative Young Kim, would require the US to advocate for Taiwan’s membership in the IMF.

The bill says that Taiwan is the 21st-largest economy in the world and the US’ 10th-largest goods trading partner, and that although it is not an IMF member, it is a member of the WTO, the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

“The experience of Taiwan in developing a vibrant and advanced economy under democratic governance and the rule of law should inform the work of the international financial institutions, including through increased participation by Taiwan in the institutions,” it said.

The PROTECT Act, sponsored by US Representative Frank Lucas, is aimed at isolating the Chinese Communist Party from the international financial system by directing the US Federal Reserve, the US Secretary of the Treasury and the US Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude Chinese representatives from the proceedings of international financial groups and organizations if China were to invade Taiwan.

The international financial organizations listed in the bill included the G20, the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the International Organization of Securities Commissions.

In the wake of the House passing the PROTECT bill, Kim wrote on X: “We cannot allow the Chinese Communist Party to keep Taiwan out of international organizations.”

“I’ll always be a voice for our freedom-loving partners across the globe,” she wrote.

"Adda Coffee closes, claiming money issues; employees say it's in response to union forming.

City, Date - In a surprising turn of events, Adda Coffee, a beloved local coffee shop, has announced its closure, citing financial challenges. However, former employees are alleging a different narrative, claiming the shutdown is a direct response to their recent efforts to form a union.

Adda Coffee, known for its cozy ambiance and specialty brews, served as a popular community hub for coffee enthusiasts and locals alike. The sudden decision to close has left patrons shocked and employees grappling with uncertainty about their futures.

According to a statement released by Adda Coffee's management, the closure is a result of financial difficulties exacerbated by the economic challenges of recent times. The statement expressed gratitude to the community for its support over the years and lamented the difficult decision to cease operations.

Despite the official explanation, former employees are painting a different picture. Several staff members allege that the closure is directly tied to their efforts to organize a union within the workplace. They claim that as discussions about forming a union gained traction, management responded by closing the doors, leaving them unemployed.

One former employee, who wished to remain anonymous, stated, ""It's disheartening to see the place we considered our second home shutting down like this. We were simply trying to advocate for fair treatment and better working conditions through unionization, and it feels like our efforts have been met with this abrupt closure.""

Labor union representatives are looking into the situation, and legal experts suggest that if the closure is proven to be a direct response to union formation, it could be a violation of labor laws.

Local residents and customers have taken to social media platforms to express their disappointment and support for the former employees. The closure raises questions about the challenges faced by small businesses in navigating economic uncertainties and the complexities of labor relations.

As the community awaits further clarification from Adda Coffee's management and potential legal actions, the incident serves as a reminder of the delicate balance businesses face in addressing financial struggles while upholding workers' rights.","generate a news article based on this title: Adda Coffee closes, claiming money issues; employees say it's in response to union forming",fake,1
"Adda Coffee closes, claiming money issues; employees say it's in response to union forming.

PITTSBURGH — All Adda Coffee & Tea House locations in Pittsburgh are closed, the company announced on its social media Thursday.

The company blames monetary losses, exacerbated by the pandemic, but employees tell Pittsburgh’s Action News 4 they believe the closure is in response to employees forming a union.

“Never were we under the assumption that any of the stores were going to close, so this is really sudden and really heartbreaking for everybody,” said Chris Gratsch, former lead barista at Adda’s Shadyside location.

Gratsch said he and at least 30 other employees announced their move to unionize Wednesday night, and now they’re looking for a new job. Gratsch believes the company shutting down is a direct response.

“Eight o’clock yesterday, we received the announcement that all four stores will be closed effective immediately,” Gratsch said.

A post on the company’s Instagram page called the business a “labor of love” but listed a different reason for the closure.

“Sadly, we have been operating at a loss since the beginning, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic,” the statement read. “We tried to stay optimistic and have been consistently re-evaluating our business model in our efforts to keep fulfilling our mission. Despite everyone’s best efforts, our monetary reserves are depleted, and we need to close our doors.”

Pittsburgh’s Action News 4 has reached out to the company but has not yet heard back.

“I really hope that the owner does the right thing and acknowledges us and makes sure that these people are taken care of because a single pay period of severance isn’t enough for people to get by,” Gratsch said.

"Main street in Seocho-gu becomes utility pole-free zone.

Seoul, South Korea - In a groundbreaking initiative, Main Street in Seocho-gu has undergone a remarkable transformation as it bids farewell to its traditional utility poles. The removal of these poles not only contributes to the enhancement of the street's aesthetics but also significantly improves safety for residents and pedestrians.

The ambitious project, spearheaded by the local municipality in collaboration with utility companies, aims to create a more visually appealing and modern urban landscape. The decision to remove utility poles from Main Street aligns with the broader urban development plan of Seocho-gu, emphasizing the creation of pedestrian-friendly spaces and sustainable infrastructure.

One of the primary motivations behind this initiative is the visual clutter caused by the numerous utility poles lining the streets. Removing them not only opens up the view but also provides an opportunity for innovative urban design and landscaping. The transformation is expected to create a more welcoming environment for both residents and visitors, encouraging community engagement and fostering a sense of pride in the neighborhood.

Safety considerations also played a pivotal role in the decision to make Main Street a utility pole-free zone. With the poles gone, the risk of accidents caused by collisions with vehicles or pedestrians tripping over uneven pavements is significantly reduced. The improved visibility along the street enhances overall safety and promotes a secure environment for everyone.

Residents and business owners on Main Street have expressed their support for the initiative, recognizing the long-term benefits it brings to the community. Local businesses anticipate increased foot traffic and improved commercial appeal due to the street's enhanced aesthetics. Additionally, residents appreciate the positive impact on property values and the overall quality of life in the area.

The removal of utility poles was carefully coordinated with utility companies to ensure that essential services are not disrupted. The companies involved have been proactive in relocating their infrastructure underground, ensuring that the seamless delivery of electricity, telecommunications, and other services is maintained.

Seocho-gu's Main Street now stands as a testament to the successful collaboration between the local government, residents, and utility companies in realizing a vision for a more modern, aesthetically pleasing, and safe urban environment. The project serves as an inspiration for other neighborhoods looking to balance functionality with a commitment to creating vibrant, livable spaces for their communities.",write a news article about Main street in Seocho-gu becomes utility pole-free zone,fake,1

"Upper St. Clair commissioner honored for service.

Robert W. Orchowski was honored recently for his service as an Upper St. Clair Township commissioner. After 26 years, Orchowski did not seek reelection for his term that ended Dec. 31. He was the longest serving commissioner in the township’s history.

Over a dozen friends and former colleagues attended an informational and general affairs meeting to honor him.

Township Manager Matthew R. Serakowski and board President Daniel R. Paoly presented Orchowski with proclamations acknowledging his impact on township history throughout his tenure.

“Commissioner Orchowski and I have worked together for all 26 years of his service on the board,” said Serakowski. “The impact he has had on the staff and community cannot be overstated. He has always treated everyone with respect and dignity. On behalf of myself and all the staff members at the township, we want to thank him for his service.”

Paoly added, “What really stands out to me about Commissioner Orchowski is the performance of his duties with dedication, fairness and intelligence. In my time on the board with him, everything he did was with the utmost respect for everyone.”

Pennsylvania Sen. Devlin Robinson and state Rep. Natalie Mihalek also presented Orchowski with proclamations.

“Commissioner Orchowski is a very dedicated person and professional,” Robinson said. “For 26 years, he has served this community in multiple capacities. We are all happy and thankful he has stayed on this long because he has made Upper St. Clair a better community.”

“There are givers and takers in this world, and Commissioner Orchowski is a giver,” added Mihalek. “He has given so much to this community, the board of commissioners and so many different people. I thank him for always being there for me personally, and I think he is the model for all public servants.”

In his years as commissioner, Orchowski has seen Upper St. Clair flourish as a community. Orchowski served as a commissioner during the approval, construction and opening of the volunteer fire department main station, Community & Recreation Center, Fields Complex at Boyce Mayview Park, Miracle League of the South Hills Field and the Casey’s Clubhouse Playground and Upper St. Clair Veterans Park.

In addition, he was an active participant in the development of many more projects and milestones throughout the township, including completion of the Perimeter Trail Extension, the redevelopment of South Hills Village, the development of the Siena at St. Clair, the renovation of Wiltshire Park and the McLaughlin Run Activity Center, the addition of lights at Boyce Mayview Fields, the installation of new street signage and the most recent multi-year renovations to the municipal building.

“Thank you to everybody here, and everybody not here, for the privilege of getting to serve Upper St. Clair for so long,” Orchowski said. “I’m going to miss the people, including all the current and former commissioners. Upper St. Clair is still in great hands. We live in a great community, have a great staff and great commissioners, so let’s keep it that way.”

"As Palo Alto prepares to upgrade grid, Tesla races to the front of the line.

Palo Alto, CA - The city of Palo Alto is moving forward with plans to upgrade its power grid, and local electric vehicle maker Tesla is making a push to be at the front of the line when it comes to integrating with the new smart grid technology.

Palo Alto Utilities has announced a $20 million initiative to upgrade the city's electrical infrastructure to support more renewable energy and improve reliability. The ""smart grid"" upgrades will allow better monitoring and control over power distribution, enabling features like dynamic electricity pricing and integration with home solar panels and batteries. 

""We want to modernize our grid to empower customers with more information and control,"" said Dean Batchelor, CEO of Palo Alto Utilities. ""This will also help us manage a more complex distribution network with more distributed energy sources like rooftop solar connected to the grid.""

Headquartered in Palo Alto, Tesla Motors has much to gain from a modernized local grid. Tesla's suite of home energy products - including the Powerwall home battery and Solar Roof - require an updated electrical infrastructure to unlock some of their capabilities around smart charging and dispatching stored solar power back to the grid.  

In recent city council meetings, Tesla representative have advocated for prioritizing technologies that support electrification and integration with battery storage as Palo Alto upgrades its infrastructure.

""As a leader in renewable energy products and services, Tesla is committed to supporting Palo Alto Utilities' forward-thinking smart grid initiatives,"" said Tesla spokesperson Sally Lorentz. ""We want to ensure these upgrades truly enable sustainable, cost-effective and reliable power for the community and Tesla owners.""

While some have questioned whether it is fair for Tesla to leverage its hometown connections and sizable local presence, most agree that the accelerate adoption of smart grid capabilities will benefit the entire community. Many local Tesla customers are eagerly awaiting system improvements that will unlock the full potential of their home solar and Powerwall batteries.

The first phase of Palo Alto's grid upgrades is set to begin next year, with plans to integrate more distributed energy sources and rollout smart meters to homes and businesses in later stages of the multi-year initiative.","generate a local news article with the title ""As Palo Alto prepares to upgrade grid, Tesla races to the front of the line""",fake,1
"As Palo Alto prepares to upgrade grid, Tesla races to the front of the line.

When Palo Alto officials launched last year an ambitious, $300 million effort to upgrade the city’s electric infrastructure, their plan was to start in residential neighborhoods with overhead wires and then move on to underground districts.
Now, however, it looks like the first beneficiaries of the city's upgrade won't be the neighborhoods that meet this profile — areas like University South and East Meadow Circle — but the corporations of Stanford Research Park, where Tesla is hoping to launch its new engineering headquarters this spring at the former HP property at 1501 Page Mill Road.
To meet this timeline, Tesla has proposed a partnership with the city to rebuild a substation at 3350 Hanover St. near its Page Mill Road campus. Under this proposed deal, which the City Council will consider on Jan. 16, Tesla would design and install the new equipment based on its expected power needs. The company would split the cost of the $24 million with the city, with each side contributing $12 million, according to a report from Tomm Marshall, assistant director for engineering at the Utilities Department.
The upgraded substation would be available to serve other customers as well, according to the Utilities Department. The city will, however, need to spend an additional $3 million to transfer the feeders that do not serve Tesla to the newly installed transformers, bringing the city’s share to $15 million.
Even though Tesla is driving this project, utility officials argue that it will benefit other customers in the area as well. Marshall's report says the existing transformers are ""undersized relative to the needs of customers in the Stanford Research Park, require a higher-than-normal level of maintenance, and are nearing or past their useful lives of 50 years.""
Vaibhav Taneja, chief financial officer of Tesla, has already signed the proposed agreement. If the council approves the proposed public-private partnership and authorizes City Manager Ed Shikada to sign the deal, Tesla’s contractors would replace the two existing 4 kilovolt (kV) transformers at the substation with two 12 kV transformers. The project also includes installing three substation breakers, a power distribution center and two 12 kV feeders.
The Tesla project represents a stark departure from Palo Alto's notoriously methodical approach to infrastructure projects. While the citywide grid upgrade is expected to take seven years and cost between $300 million and $350 million to complete, a significant component of the Stanford Research Park project could be completed in just a few months.
Marshall noted that it typically takes three to four years to upgrade a substation. Tesla, however, is looking to finish all construction and energize its new building by April 2024.
""The City cannot meet this timeline under normal City processes due to insufficient staffing to coordinate the design and construction of all facilities and the time required to complete the City public procurement process,"" the report states.
The report notes that Tesla is not only chipping in for the cost of the replacement but also paying extra to have the project expedited. Even though the City Council has yet to discuss — much less approve — the deal, Tesla has already gone out to bid on the project, and it has already selected a contractor to undertake the upgrade.
The substation improvement agreement is also highly unusual in that Tesla is explicitly authorized to ""take the lead in design and construction"" of the upgrade, which upon completion, would be transferred to the city’s ownership. The company will be required to submit written progress reports and to meet with city officials once a month.
Both parties in the proposed partnership are expecting to reap long-term benefits from the deal. Tesla will pay a monthly fee to the city in exchange for having up to 11,200 kVA of capacity reserved for its needs. The city, for its part, would get help with both funding and implementing a utility project from Tesla, a company that famously moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to Austin, Texas, in late 2021 but that has only expanded its local footprint since then.
""These upgrades will serve Tesla, accommodate customers in the Stanford Research Park, replace outdated infrastructure, and modernize and reorganize the substation for greater efficiency,"" the Utilities Department report states.
The company announced its takeover of the former HP site nearly a year ago when its CEO Elon Musk and Gov. Gavin Newsom held a press conference last year announcing Tesla’s plans to expand in Palo Alto.
""This is a poetic transition from the company that founded Silicon Valley to Tesla,"" Musk said at the Feb. 22 event. ""And we’re very excited to make this our global engineering headquarters in California.""
As Tesla races to get its new engineering headquarters running, Palo Alto is inching ahead with its broad upgrade to the electric grid, a project that city officials say is necessary to accommodate its goal of switching people away from natural gas to clean electricity. During an October presentation, Utilities Director Dean Batchelor said he expects the grid upgrade to stretch from 2024 to 2032.
The Utilities Department plans to start with the reconstruction of the overhead system, which makes up 70% of the city’s grid. This component is expected to be completed by the end of 2027. The city would move on to the underground system, Batchelor said.
The project will include converting 4 kV lines to 12 kV to accommodate a growing demand for electric appliances and electric vehicles, Batchelor said at an Oct. 19 seminar sponsored by the League of Women Voters. The average peak demand in the current system is between 3 and 3.5 kVA (kilovolt amps), he said. The upgrade would support between 6 and 8 kVA.
""Once we get to (that) point, we can start thinking about having 100% electrification, which also includes EVs,"" Batchelor said.

"Gov. J.B. Pritzker, heading to Iowa for Biden, dismisses president’s low poll numbers.

On the eve of Iowa’s Republican caucuses, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Sunday dismissed new national polling show low job approval for President Joe Biden, saying “the battle hasn’t been joined” until GOP voters pick their nominee.

Pritzker, who is scheduled to be in Des Moines on Monday for the caucuses as a surrogate for Biden’s reelection, acknowledged on ABC’s “This Week” program that former President Donald Trump is the likely GOP nominee based on polling. But he criticized the entire Republican field — including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley — as “MAGA Republicans, espousing things that are not good for the American public,,” using the shorthand for Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.

“It’s the Republicans that are trying to take your freedoms away. It’s the Republicans that are trying to take away your Social Security and your Medicare. It’s the Republicans that are basically fighting against the working families of America. And it’s Joe Biden, who has been lifting up the economy,” Pritzker said. “Things are getting better in this country and over the course of an election year, as the economy continues to improve, you’re going to see (Biden’s) poll numbers improve too.”

“Not until (Republicans) choose a nominee will we truly be in this battle. And then it’s a choice,” Pritzker said.

A new ABC-Ipsos poll released Sunday found Biden with an approval rating of 33%, worse than Trump’s 36% low during his presidency. Asking poll respondents to look back at Trump’s presidency, 41% approved of how he handled the job. One-third of poll respondents held a favorable opinion of Biden while 35% had a favorable view of Trump. The survey of 2,228 adults, conducted Jan. 4-8, had an error margin of 2.5%.

Pritzker, a member of Biden’s national advisory board, is scheduled to join the board’s co-chair, movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, in representing the Biden campaign at a news conference in Iowa’s capital city on Monday.

With concerns about Biden’s age of 81 persisting, even among Democrats, Pritzker sought to rephrase questions about the president to instead tout the concept that as Biden has gotten older he’s attained more wisdom, experience and empathy. The poll showed only 28% said Biden has the mental sharpness required of the presidency compared to 47% for Trump, who is 77 years old.

“Maybe we ought to start by just acknowledging that Joe Biden has years of experience, that when you talk about someone’s age, you’re also talking about the wisdom that they gained over many years and how they’ve demonstrated their empathy that they’ve learned from so many experiences,” Pritzker said.

“Joe Biden and Donald Trump are roughly the same age,” Pritzker said. “Do you think Donald Trump has learned empathy in his life? He has not. Joe Biden has demonstrated it at every turn.”

With Chicago receiving more than 38,000 migrants from the border, according to city figures reported Friday, Pritzker blamed Republican intransigence in Congress for not working toward comprehensive immigration reform as well as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for engaging in a “political game” of sending migrants to Democratic cities undergoing severe winter weather conditions.

“He doesn’t care about the migrants. He doesn’t care about the fact that they’re going to suffer if they’re sent to certainly the Upper Midwest, as he is doing now,” Pritzker said.

But Pritzker also acknowledged that while Congress needs to act, “I think that the president needs to do more.”

Of the Republican contenders for president, Pritzker noted that “it doesn’t look good for the people who are running against Donald Trump” but said he thinks the GOP race will continue “for perhaps another month or two before there is really a clear front-runner.” The respected Iowa Poll, published last week by the Des Moines Register, showed Trump leading among likely caucusgoers with 48%, trailed by Haley with 20% and DeSantis with 16%.

On Friday, U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood of Peoria became the last of Illinois’ three Republican House members to endorse Trump for president. U.S. Reps. Mary Miller of Hindsboro and Mike Bost of Murphysboro previously backed the former president.

Bost is facing a March primary contest against unsuccessful 2022 GOP governor candidate Darren Bailey of Xenia. Both Bost and Bailey also are running as Trump-nominating delegates and each has sought the former president’s endorsement for Congress.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-jb-pritzker-iowa-biden-2024-20240114-vxndjkftg5d6boug7bebpjnjf4-story.html,real,0
"Gov. J.B. Pritzker, heading to Iowa for Biden, dismisses president’s low poll numbers.

In a recent move that has sparked both support and controversy, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is set to visit Iowa as a part of a campaign effort for President Joe Biden. Despite President Biden's current low poll numbers, Gov. Pritzker remains steadfast in his support, demonstrating a strong allegiance to the Biden administration.

Gov. Pritzker, known for his progressive policies in Illinois, has been a vocal advocate for the Biden administration's efforts on various fronts, including economic recovery, healthcare, and climate change. His trip to Iowa, a key state in presidential elections, is seen as a strategic move to bolster support for President Biden ahead of the 2024 election.

In a statement to the press, Gov. Pritzker addressed concerns regarding the president's low poll numbers, stating, ""Polls are not always a reflection of the ground reality. President Biden has been working tirelessly to address the challenges facing our nation, and I believe his efforts will be recognized and appreciated by the American people in due course.""

Political analysts view Gov. Pritzker's visit to Iowa as a sign of the Democratic Party's commitment to maintaining unity and support for the president, despite the challenges posed by the current political climate. The governor's trip is expected to include meetings with local leaders, party activists, and a series of public events aimed at drumming up support for President Biden.

Critics, however, argue that the governor's efforts may be misplaced, given the president's waning popularity and the growing dissatisfaction among voters with the administration's handling of key issues. Some political commentators suggest that Gov. Pritzker's time and resources might be better spent addressing pressing issues in Illinois.

Despite the criticism, Gov. Pritzker's camp remains optimistic about the impact of his visit to Iowa. A spokesperson for the governor commented, ""Gov. Pritzker's leadership and vision align closely with President Biden's, and we are confident that his presence in Iowa will energize and mobilize supporters.""

As the political landscape continues to evolve, all eyes will be on Iowa to see how Gov. Pritzker's visit influences public opinion and shapes the narrative around President Biden's re-election campaign. The governor's trip is set to kick off a series of high-profile visits by key Democratic figures to crucial battleground states, underscoring the party's determination to maintain control of the White House in the upcoming election.","write a news article with the title: Gov.

"Pittsburgh's underground streams pose challenges and opportunities to fight climate change.

Pittsburgh, known for its rich industrial history, is facing a unique environmental challenge as it grapples with the impact of its underground streams on climate change. These hidden waterways, while presenting challenges, also offer opportunities for innovative solutions in the city's quest for sustainability.

The city's underground streams have long been overlooked, but recent studies highlight their crucial role in the broader ecosystem. Increased urbanization, industrial activities, and climate change have put these subterranean water sources at risk, leading to potential consequences for both the environment and the community.

Challenges associated with these underground streams include pollution, habitat degradation, and altered flow patterns. Efforts to address these issues involve a multi-faceted approach that combines environmental conservation, community engagement, and technological solutions. Local environmental organizations are collaborating with researchers and policymakers to develop strategies that mitigate the negative impact on these vital waterways.

However, amidst these challenges, there are opportunities for Pittsburgh to lead the way in innovative climate change solutions. Green infrastructure projects, such as restoring and protecting riparian zones along underground streams, are gaining traction. These initiatives not only contribute to climate resilience but also enhance the overall quality of life for residents by creating green spaces and promoting biodiversity.

Additionally, the potential for renewable energy generation from these streams is being explored. Harnessing the power of flowing water through sustainable technologies could provide a clean energy source for the city, reducing its reliance on traditional energy methods and lowering carbon emissions.

Community involvement is seen as a key component in addressing the challenges and maximizing the opportunities presented by Pittsburgh's underground streams. Local residents, environmental activists, and policymakers are collaborating to raise awareness, implement conservation measures, and advocate for policies that prioritize the protection of these critical water resources.

As Pittsburgh stands at the intersection of industrial legacy and environmental stewardship, the city has the chance to transform its approach to climate change. By recognizing the challenges posed by its underground streams and embracing the opportunities they offer for sustainable development, Pittsburgh can emerge as a model for other urban areas seeking to balance growth with environmental responsibility.",generate a news article with the title Pittsburgh's underground streams pose challenges and opportunities to fight climate change,fake,1
"Pittsburgh's underground streams pose challenges and opportunities to fight climate change.

Much has been made of Pittsburgh's mythical Fourth River. While this urban legend (and real aquifer) makes for interesting trivia, it also steals the show from the dozens of creeks and streams — ""runs,"" in local parlance — which flow beneath the feet of thousands of locals.
The city's hidden waterways range in size from seasonal trickles to continuously flowing brooks with their own small watersheds. Many of them now serve as part of the city's stormwater and sewer network. In spite of that, environmentalists and some local officials see potential in these covert culverts. Beyond making for attractive greenspaces, they have the potential to absorb Pittsburgh's expected increase in rainfall thanks to global climate change.

""I don't think a lot of people realize there are stream networks cutting beneath our streets and backyards,"" Mike Hiller, executive director of UpstreamPgh, tells Pittsburgh City Paper. UpstreamPgh, previously the Nine Mile Run Watershed Association, is a nonprofit focused on ""stormwater problem-solving"" and restoration of local streams.

Putting streams underground was an early approach to sanitation and flood control in a region with an abundance of water. ""Streams created flooding, so there was an element of more safety by putting in pipes,"" Hiller says. Burying streams was the ""accepted methodology at the time."" That's changed — environmentalists now see benefits to daylighting, or bringing buried streams back to the surface, as well as other, greener approaches to the city's overabundance of water. Local projects, including UpstreamPgh's lauded restoration of Nine Mile Run, show that there are environmental, recreational, and practical benefits to daylighting streams.

However, most of Pittsburgh's channelized creeks are directly beneath some of the city's densest development and inextricably tied into the sewer system, occasionally leading to combined sewer overflow (CSO) that dumps raw sewage into the three rivers. These issues have forced local environmentalists and policymakers to get creative with how they think about water as the city seeks a greener future.",https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/pittsburghs-underground-streams-pose-challenges-and-opportunities-to-fight-climate-change-25265357,real,0

"Van Alstyne Gets a New Ambulance for the Fire Department.

Chief Ryan Dockery of the Van Alstyne Fire Department met with me to discuss the brand new ambulance the department ordered as well as the new public safety facility coming to Van Alstyne.

This new ambulance brings the Fire Department vehicles to:
2 engines
2 ambulances
2 brush trucks
1 command vehicle

And the current roles at the fire department are 12 full time positions, 9 paramedics, and 3 positions available

When did we move forward to purchase of new ambulance
Chief Dockery knows the lead time for the required chassis can be up to 2 years, so being proactive to stay within the desired equipment replacement plan, early 2022 quotes were requested and the selection was made. A proposal was taken to city council for approval and the order was placed in May of 2022. We anticipate we will get it as early as the last week of October.

Focus behind this addition
We know we are growing, not shrinking. But this is replacing older equipment to maintain adequate services within the equipment replacement plan. The new ambulance is replacing our oldest ambulance that was purchased in 2013, which is being traded in.

Additional new vehicle plans
The VAFD has also ordered a new fire engine, and this will serve as the new frontline engine and putting the old frontline engine in reserve. The old reserve engine will be sold. The estimated completion date is summer 2024.

This engine is being purchased with funds from the agreement with the Mantua Point development. There are also funds to order another ambulance. We may order another ambulance soon with these funds to stay proactive with the vehicle replacement plan because of the lead time needed.

New Public Safety facility
The new public safety facility will house police, fire and have a community area. FD is being designed to be a double company station, which means it will operate an ambulance, ladder and engine and possibly a brush, and would also house administration.

We currently are a single company station because we don’t have a ladder. We have a fire engine and an ambulance.

A Fire Marshall would be hired when the city grows into that. In planning for this facility, the design allows us to grow into it in the next several years. The plan for this facility is to fit our department for many many years into the future as Van Alstyne continues to grow.

New hires
In 2024, 1 new firefighter position will become available in January, and that will bring all shifts to 5 personnel per shit.

Future plans include additional command and administrative staff as well as a Fire Marshall position.",https://cityofvanalstyne.us/new-ambulance/,real,0
"Goose dies after being found shot with arrow; Irvine police ask for public's help in investigation.

IRVINE, Calif. (KABC) -- It's a picture of a harmless Egyptian goose that stirs up a lot emotions for animal lovers when you look closely.

The bird is pictured with a bright green arrow sticking out of its torso.

Debbie McGuire, executive director of Wetlands & Wildlife Care Center said, ""Some of these geese and ducks in the parks are habituated to people so they don't always flee which they should and people can get people close to them and if they have a weapon and they can get them at point blank range so it's pretty sad.""

Irvine Police said the goose was spotted on Dec. 28 near College Park Elementary School.

Irvine Police Sgt. Karie Davies said, ""Animal Services officers went there, located the goose, saw that it needed immediate medical attention, picked the goose up, put it in the van and on the way to get medical attention unfortunately the goose passed away.""

The Irvine Police Department wants to find out what happened but suspect the animal was targeted.

According to Irvine Police Chief Elizabeth Hartley, the department is treating this incident very seriously. ""This act of violence against a defenseless animal is not only illegal but deeply troubling. We are committed to finding those responsible,"" Chief Hartley stated in a press briefing.

Animal welfare groups have expressed their horror at the incident. A spokesperson for the Irvine Animal Protection League, Michael Torres, said, ""It's a sad day for Irvine's wildlife. Such actions have no place in our community. We urge anyone with information to help the police in their investigation.""

The park, popular among locals for its serene environment and thriving bird population, has been left in shock. Regular park-goer Janet Liu expressed her distress: ""We come here for peace and to enjoy nature. To think that someone could do this is heartbreaking.""

The Irvine Police Department has announced that they will be increasing patrols in the area and working closely with animal welfare organizations to prevent future incidents. They have also reminded the public that harming wildlife is a criminal offense and can lead to severe penalties.

As the investigation continues, the community is left grappling with the senseless violence against one of its most innocent inhabitants. The police urge anyone with information to contact the Irvine PD Tip Line.

"In Bengaluru, senior journalist lost Rs 1.2 crore in FedEx courier scam.

Bengaluru, [Insert Date]: In a shocking turn of events, a senior journalist from Bengaluru became the latest victim of a sophisticated courier scam, losing a staggering Rs 1.2 crore to fraudsters posing as FedEx couriers. The journalist, whose identity has been withheld for security reasons, was reportedly tricked into transferring the funds as part of a bogus anti-narcotics operation.

The elaborate scam began with a phone call from individuals claiming to be from a well-known courier service. The journalist was informed of a supposed package addressed to them, which was intercepted and found to contain illegal substances. The scammers, adept at social engineering, convinced the victim that a money transfer was required to clear their name from the ensuing legal complications.

The Bengaluru City Police have confirmed that a case has been registered and an investigation is underway. Cybercrime experts are scrutinizing the incident, which highlights the increasing sophistication of online frauds. The scammers reportedly used high-end technology to mimic official numbers and create a sense of urgency and authenticity.

This incident has raised alarms over the growing trend of scam calls in the city, prompting authorities to issue a public warning. Citizens are advised to be cautious of unsolicited calls asking for money transfers or personal information, regardless of the apparent legitimacy.

A senior officer from the Cyber Crime Division stated, “The public must remain vigilant. Always verify the credibility of such calls independently and never share personal banking details over the phone.”

The journalist, recovering from the ordeal, has urged the public to be more skeptical of such fraudulent schemes. ""I hope my experience serves as a cautionary tale for others. It

's a hard lesson, but we must question and verify everything, especially when it comes to financial transactions,"" they said in a statement to the press.

As the investigation proceeds, cybersecurity units are pushing for increased awareness programs, emphasizing the need for better digital literacy among citizens of all ages. Banks and courier companies are also stepping up their efforts to educate customers about such frauds.

Law enforcement agencies have been coordinating with banks and courier services to track down the culprits. There is a concerted push to enhance monitoring mechanisms and quick response protocols to prevent such scams from causing significant financial harm in the future.

The Times of India urges its readers to stay informed and cautious about such fraudulent activities. We will continue to report on this story as more details emerge and provide updates on the steps being taken to combat such cybercrimes.

"In Bengaluru, senior journalist lost Rs 1.2 crore in FedEx courier scam.

BENGALURU: Investigation into the cybercrime case in which a city-based senior journalist lost Rs 1.2 crore to online fraudsters revealed that the money had been transferred to multiple bank accounts in several north Indian states, including Bihar, the neighbouring state of Kerala, and Dubai.

While Bengaluru police have succeeded in freezing Rs 37 lakh from the bank accounts of the criminal masterminds and their mules, the trail related to the rest of the money is being pieced together.

“We're trying to recover as much money as possible. The accused have taken
the fake FedEx courier scam route to con the journalist,” a sleuth said.

The fake courier scam is one of most notorious methods adopted by
cybercriminals: They call up the victims posing as Fedex staff and enforcement
sleuths, accuse them of smuggling banned substances, and force them to send
money to ascertain the latter’s credentials.

Seventy-year-old Bhavna (name changed to protect her identity), who resides
in the central business district, was under ‘digital arrest’ by fake cops from
December 15 to 23, when she lost the money.

The drama unfolded when she received a WhatsApp call from an unknown
number at 12.23pm on December 15. The caller told her there was a parcel in
her name — containing 240 grams of MDMA, passports and credit cards — that
was being sent to Taiwan from Mumbai. While a shocked Bhavna maintained
she hadn’t sent any such parcel, the caller said her Aadhaar card was being
used to send it and a case had been registered against her.

Subsequently, the fraudsters made her download an application. They told her
that money-laundering activities were observed in her bank accounts and
directed her to make a security deposit to Reserve Bank of India. They
promised to return the money to her bank accounts after verification and
warned her against speaking with others. From December 15 to 23, she
stepped out of home only once to transfer Rs 48 lakh through RTGS to the
fraudster’s bank account.

Bhavna told police the miscreants used to call at 9am every day and end the
call around 2am. A senior police officer said a case has been registered under
the Information Technology Act and IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly
inducing delivery of property).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sr-journalist-lost-1-2-crore-in-fedex-courier-scam/articleshow/106881671.cms,real,0
"Chantilly native brings chills to a local pool.

Chantilly native Joe Zemaitis grew up loving his times at the Brookfield Swim Club. So, it was no surprise to see his excitement when the International Ice Swimming Association USA (IISA USA) announced the 2024 U.S. National Ice Swimming Championships in Chantilly at the Brookfield Swim Club from Jan. 12-14. 

The International Ice Swimming Association (IISA) was formed in 2009 with a vision to make ice swimming an Olympic sport. It holds swims in 46 countries, represents 73 countries worldwide, and has 4,736 international swimmer members. IISA USA, launched in 2021, has 281 swimmer members.

Zemaitis said the Chantilly location was selected for the metro, proximity to major airports, the tremendous support from the local swim community, and because IISA expects to host a strong multi-national field of swimmers and looks forward to hosting their first U.S. Ice Swimming Nationals. 

“Brookfield came to mind as a great venue because I knew had some familiarity with and we approached them with the idea and have been working over the last year to kind of put the details together and bringing exciting events to the area,” Zemaitis said. “We did a nationwide search, we looked at several places, we reached out to places in Massachusetts and Indiana, and just really connected well with the group at Brookfield.”

Swimming was always part of Zemaitis’ and his family’s lives. Zemaitis’ family moved to Arizona in the 90s; through the years, he has supported the Breakers financially as a sponsor and commemorated the 2023 Breakers’ Relay and Divisional Championship wins with team t-shirts. His older sister and younger brother were also swimmers and went on to compete in college. 

His fiancé Megan, an Arizona native, was also a swimmer. Now living in Arizona, Zemaitis runs a swim team called Swim Neptune, which offers opportunities for developing young athletes at all skill and experience levels. 

Ice Swimming was new for Zemaitis. In 2019, he did my first ice mile in 2019. His close friend, Jerry George, is credited for inspiring Zemaitis to explore this sport. In February 2019, both men did the ice mile, which is swimming a full mile in water under five degrees celsius. Zemaitis saw it as an exciting, unique challenge. 

Over this three-day period, there will be five sessions. On Friday, the 1000-meter competition will take place. On Saturday and Sunday, there will be two daily sessions; one will start at 10 a.m., and then the afternoon session begins at 2 p.m. Zemaitis hopes this event will build some momentum, raise the visibility of this sport, and continue the momentum for next year.

Around 50 people are expected to participate in the event, representing 17 states and seven countries. Following the three-day event, on Jan. 15, Brookfield Swim Club will hold a Splash and Dash Polar Plunge.",https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/sports/chantilly-native-brings-chills-to-a-local-pool/article_c99f794c-b0b7-11ee-b84a-1ba6a14c70da.html,real,0

"These Plano neighbors have created a tradition of filling their yards with holiday inflatables.

According to Gregory and Katie Tallos, there’s an entire culture when it comes to inflatables.

Plano residents may have noticed a cul-de-sac with two houses filled with holiday-themed inflatables located near Custer Road and Park Boulevard. The two houses, located on Ports O’Call Court, have over 250 inflatables between the two of them.

Gregory said that he and Katie moved in their house on Ports O’Call Court in 2015 and put out their first inflatables two years later. The first inflatable the Tallos found was a 20-foot tall Frosty the Snowman.

“Through 2017, 2018 and 2019, we kind of learned about inflatables and how they worked,” Gregory said. “The neighbors across the street moved here in 2019.”

From there, Brenda Buchanan, the Tallos’ neighbor, and the Tallos household began putting out more and more inflatables until each of their yards were filled.

“I noticed my neighbor across the street really decking out his yard,” Buchanan said. “I always lived in the country, so we didn't do a whole lot of decorating. I realized that I get to decorate my yard, and every year it has just kind of gotten more and more and more and more. We both kind of compete against each other, but it's a friendly competition.”

Both Buchanan and the Tallos household said they are out every day performing maintenance on their inflatables, from sealing tears to draining them of moisture, ensuring each inflatable is fastened down, checking electrical plugs and more.

The households begin putting up their decorations as soon as Halloween ends. Gregory said the process includes cleaning up all the leaves within the nooks and crannies under and around all the inflatables, mowing the lawn and mapping out where each inflatable goes. Once it’s time to put away the inflatables – generally around Jan. 6 – the households let the inflatables dry as needed, then roll them up to be placed in tote boxes.

“There's a whole culture when it comes to inflatables, believe it or not,” Gregory said. “There are those that keep them in their original boxes and try to pack it into the box every single year. We do not abide by that because there's no way you can get everything into form as perfect as the box comes. We put everything in totes.”

Gregory said that as he and Katie have learned more about inflatables, they’ve joined different forums and Facebook groups to learn more about maintenance and find unique inflatables for their yard.

As more visitors have come out to see the houses, Buchanan and the Tallos have put fencing around their yards to keep visitors from walking among the inflatables. Due to the number of cords, stakes, motors and other obstacles, the Tallos said entering the yard would pose a risk of injury. Visitors are allowed to walk up the houses’ walkways and enjoy the displays from the sidewalk. Additionally, drivers are encouraged not to park within the cul-de-sac, as it impedes residents’ and first responders’ ability to navigate the area.

Those who visit are welcome to leave canned goods near the door of the Tallos household, at 2905 Ports O’Call Court, to be delivered to Minnie’s Food Pantry.

Additionally, children will get to take photos with Santa from 5-8 p.m. on Christmas Eve.",https://starlocalmedia.com/planocourier/news/these-plano-neighbors-have-created-a-tradition-of-filling-their-yards-with-holiday-inflatables/article_b25ab676-a02b-11ee-80e8-4f17603d7e1a.html,real,0

From towering snowmen to animated reindeer, the streets come alive with colorful lights and whimsical characters, bringing joy to both young and old.

Residents of this festive community take pride in their annual tradition, showcasing creativity and spreading holiday spirit. The initiative began several years ago when a few neighbors decided to brighten up the neighborhood during the holiday season. Since then, the tradition has grown, with more families joining in each year.

""I love seeing the smiles on people's faces as they walk or drive by. It's become a wonderful tradition that brings our community together,"" says Sarah Thompson, a longtime resident and one of the enthusiasts behind the initiative.

The joyous atmosphere has not only fostered a sense of unity among neighbors but has also inspired them to give back to the community. This year, the residents are calling on their fellow Plano citizens to join them in spreading kindness by supporting a local food pantry.

John Davis, another resident participating in the festive tradition, encourages everyone to embrace the spirit of giving. ""While we enjoy the festive lights and inflatables, let's also remember those who may be facing challenges during the holiday season. We can make a difference by supporting our local food pantry and ensuring that everyone in our community has a warm meal to enjoy.""

To amplify the impact, the community is urging readers to contribute to the local food pantry through donations of non-perishable food items or monetary support. Information on drop-off locations and ways to contribute can be found on the food pantry's website.

Local residents have expressed gratitude for the initiative and the sense of community it brings. Mary Johnson, a neighbor who appreciates the effort, shares, ""It's heartening to see our community come together for a common cause. The holiday season is not just about decorations; it's about spreading love and helping those in need.""

"Final hearing on whether warehouse will be built on old Nabisco site in New Jersey.

NEW JERSEY — The final hearing on the controversial proposal to construct a massive warehouse complex on the historic site of the former Nabisco factory in New Jersey is set to take place today. The decision will mark the culmination of months of heated debate and public discourse surrounding the future of this iconic location.

The proposed development, spearheaded by BigBox Warehousing Solutions, aims to transform the now-defunct cookie factory site into a state-of-the-art logistics hub. The project promises to bring significant economic benefits, including job creation and increased commercial activity in the region. Proponents argue that the warehouse will position New Jersey as a key player in the rapidly growing e-commerce and logistics industry.

However, the project has faced staunch opposition from various community groups and environmental activists. Critics of the plan raise concerns over potential environmental impacts, including increased traffic congestion and pollution. There is also a strong sentimental attachment to the old Nabisco site, which has been a landmark in the community for over a century. Preservationists advocate for the site's historical significance, proposing alternative uses that honor its industrial past.

The debate extends beyond the local community, drawing attention from state officials and national environmental groups. Both sides have presented their arguments in a series of public hearings and town hall meetings, leading up to today's final hearing.

At the heart of the discussion is a fundamental question about the balance between economic development and preservation of local heritage and environment. The decision by the New Jersey Planning Board will not only determine the fate of the old Nabisco site but also set a precedent for future development projects in the state.

The final hearing, expected to draw a large crowd, will include statements from BigBox Warehousing Solutions, environmental experts, community leaders, and public comments. The outcome of today's hearing is eagerly anticipated, with significant implications for the community and the region's economic future.

"Mass Grave Recalls the Ugly Past of a City Where ‘Life Is Sweeter’.

In a shocking discovery, a mass grave has been unearthed in the heart of a city that has long prided itself on being a haven where ""life is sweeter."" The grim finding has sent shockwaves through the community, forcing residents to confront a dark chapter from their city's history.

The mass grave, discovered during a construction project, is believed to date back to a period marked by social upheaval and civil unrest. Authorities are working diligently to investigate the origins of the grave and identify the individuals buried within it. Initial reports suggest that the site may be linked to a troubled era in the city's past, challenging the narrative of the idyllic life that residents have come to associate with their home.

The city, known for its picturesque landscapes and vibrant cultural scene, has long prided itself on its commitment to progress and inclusivity. However, the discovery of the mass grave has prompted many to reevaluate the city's history and question the extent to which it has reckoned with its past.

Local historians are delving into archives to shed light on the events that may have led to the creation of the mass grave. Community leaders are calling for transparency and a thorough investigation to ensure that the truth is uncovered, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.

Residents, initially shocked by the news, are now engaging in conversations about the city's history and its impact on the present. Some are expressing a sense of betrayal, feeling that the city's past has been glossed over or intentionally ignored. Others are calling for a more nuanced understanding of the historical complexities that shaped the community.

The mayor has convened a special task force to oversee the investigation and has pledged full cooperation with law enforcement and historical experts. In a press conference, the mayor stated, ""While we cannot change our past, we can control how we address it in the present. Our city must confront its history, no matter how painful, and work towards a more just and equitable future.""

As the investigation unfolds, the city finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the tension between its carefully crafted image as a place where ""life is sweeter"" and the harsh realities of its past. The mass grave serves as a stark reminder that even the most picturesque cities may harbor untold stories, and the journey towards reconciliation and understanding is often a challenging one.",generate a news article with this title: Mass Grave Recalls the Ugly Past of a City Where ‘Life Is Sweeter’,fake,1
"Mass Grave Recalls the Ugly Past of a City Where ‘Life Is Sweeter’.

In Sugar Land, Texas, there’s a refrain you may hear from residents — an unofficial city motto of sorts: Life is sweeter here.

By many measures, it is. This Houston suburb is affluent, with a median household income nearly 70 percent higher than the nation’s. One of the world’s largest oil companies, Schlumberger, has a sprawling campus here. The crown jewel of its current development boom is the Imperial Char House, the sugar refinery that gave the town its name and will soon become the centerpiece of a complex including luxury apartments, museums and a distillery.

The city’s lure is so strong that it was chosen to host the inaugural Honeyland festival, a two-day celebration of Black food and music to be held this weekend, with a long lineup of celebrities that includes Mary J. Blige, Miguel and the chef Marcus Samuelsson.

But beneath Sugar Land’s success lies a disturbing piece of Black history. For decades after slavery was abolished in the United States, a prison farm that grew sugar for the Imperial refinery relied on the forced labor of prison inmates, most of them Black men, including many who had been locked up for conduct as minor as loitering or not having a job. The practice, known as convict leasing and used throughout the South, created such brutal conditions that many Sugar Land inmates died within two years after being incarcerated.

In 2018, the remains of 95 African Americans — 94 men and one believed to have been a woman — were found during the construction of a technical school in Sugar Land. The discovery drew national news coverage and calls for a proper memorial, research into the convicts’ lives and broader education about convict leasing.

Five years later, the remains still sit, unidentified, in a makeshift graveyard facing a school parking lot. The few public testaments to the lives of these people — known as the Sugar Land 95 — include some references on the city’s website and in local museums, and a small exhibit in a Sugar Land school hallway.

Several groups have sprung up to push for a more robust memorial, but their efforts have been stalled by bitter disagreements about how to mark this history, and who should pay for it.

Sugar Land officials initially offered to move the remains to a city-owned cemetery, but the proposal failed to win public support and they have since dropped out of discussions. Fort Bend County, which includes Sugar Land, set aside $4 million in 2020 to build a park around the remains, but has since reduced that commitment to $1.5 million.

Many of the people pushing for a memorial say they’re not counting on government support, given the lack of progress so far and the grimness of the history they want to see acknowledged.

“It’s ugly,” said Marilyn Moore, who founded the nonprofit Friends of the Sugar Land 95 to help manage the memorialization efforts. “They don’t want it. It wasn’t in the history books. It has not been taught. And so now that they are becoming aware, they don’t want to talk about it.”

Back in the 1990s, her husband, Reginald Moore, a former prison guard, began telling anyone who would listen that leased prison laborers had been buried in unmarked graves throughout the area, and campaigning for help in finding and preserving those sites. He was still pushing for a memorial when he died in 2020 at age 60.

Sugar Land is only one of several communities across the country — including Tracy City, Tenn., and Clemson, S.C. — where mass, unmarked graves of African Americans have recently been found. People in a number of those places have been looking to Sugar Land for guidance on how to proceed.

In Sugar Land, the task of figuring all of this out has fallen to the Fort Bend Independent School District, which owns the land where the remains were found. The district succeeded in creating a curriculum on convict leasing and persuading the state to allow its teaching in Texas schools — no small feat in a state that sets strict limits on how students can be taught about slavery. And school officials have completed a plan to build an outdoor exhibit and plaza around the cemetery, using the money promised by the county.

Allen Bogard, who as city manager from 2001 to 2020 created a task force to decide how to bury and memorialize the Sugar Land 95, believes the state, which leased out the convicts and profited mightily from the deal, should be leading the charge. But he said state officials prefer to leave the work to the district, which lacks the money and experience to manage a cemetery, much less identify the remains and spread their story. (The office of Gov. Greg Abbott did not respond to requests for comment.)

“I believe everybody just wants to bury it,” Mr. Bogard said. “It’s an embarrassment. It runs completely counter to who Sugar Land is today.”

‘Hellhole on the Brazos’
The Sugar Land of today has one of the fastest-growing populations in the country. In 2021, U.S. News ranked Fort Bend as the nation's fifth most ethnically diverse county. But of the city’s nearly 110,000 residents, just 7.2 percent are Black, about half the national figure.

In a city of lavish homes and freshly paved roads, the Sugar Land 95 cemetery is notably spare, set off by a thin chain-rope fence and two plaques that explain how the remains were discovered. The gray gravestones are all numbered and inscribed with the same word: “Unknown.” A state historical marker will be installed next year.

That history began in the 1820s, when settlers established sugar plantations, bringing with them enslaved people. The 13th Amendment outlawed slavery in 1865, but a loophole allowed the state to lease out its prisoners to plantation owners to fill the labor gap.

The area that is now Sugar Land was so swampy and mosquito-infested, and the work of cultivating sugar cane so backbreaking, that it became known as the “hellhole on the Brazos.” Convict leasing was phased out in Sugar Land in the early 20th century, but even after Texas abolished the practice in 1910, the state bought farms and forced prisoners to work them until the 1980s.

The discovery of the Sugar Land 95 has national significance, said Robert Perkinson, the author of “Texas Tough: The Rise of a Prison Empire.” The area’s use of convict leasing, he said, was so expansive and lucrative that it created the template for a modern prison system that prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation, and for the continued use of prison labor by businesses.

Today, Texas is torn by political divisions that hinder the examination of that history, said Dexter McCoy, a Fort Bend County commissioner who represents a precinct near the Sugar Land 95 site. “Where we are now, we cannot agree on what facts are facts,” he said, “and so that complicates the situation that much more.”

Mr. McCoy, who worked for the school district during the discovery, grew so frustrated by the inaction over the Sugar Land 95 that he struck out on his own. He is using $4 million in county money to build an African American memorial, scheduled to open in 2025, on the grounds of a Black cemetery in his precinct that will include 95 trees in honor of the workers.

The school district, meanwhile, is raising money to build its outdoor memorial. But the district hasn’t asked the city for funding, said Chassidy Olainu-Alade, a curriculum coordinator who is overseeing the project.

“We haven’t been able to even establish a working relationship on the matter,” she said, since the district rejected the city’s offer to reinter the remains, which many activists both in and outside Sugar Land wanted to keep in their original resting place.

The school district, she said, is “trying to strike that balance between doing the right thing and having very little resources dedicated to doing it because it’s not in the hands of a municipality.” (Doug Adolph, a spokesman for the city, confirmed that Sugar Land has not allocated funding for the memorial because it is a school district project.)

In 2022, Ms. Olainu-Alade helped the district set up the small exhibit inside a school, with the aid of Ms. Moore and community members. Ms. Olainu-Alade and her team created the new curriculum about convict leasing, which local classrooms have incorporated in creative ways: Forensics students, for instance, learn to analyze skeletal remains using photos and other data on the Sugar Land 95.

But other groups championing the Sugar Land 95 have found the district’s efforts lacking.

The Society of Justice and Equality for the People of Sugar Land is pushing for a museum showing the national scope of convict leasing. Robin Cole, who runs the group, said her organization had applied for grants that would also fund a traveling exhibit and virtual museum.

Image
The Convict Leasing and Labor Project, founded by Mr. Moore and Jay Jenkins, says the school district is failing to honor the 95 people by not completing DNA testing to identify the remains before building a memorial. (The group did not respond to requests for an interview.)

A self-funded research group has begun DNA testing, which could take many years to complete, said Abigail Fisher, one of the researchers. Two others, Helen Graham and Sandra Rodgers, have combed state records and uncovered information about 75 people who died at the prison farm. The group also knows, from its analysis of the remains, that they endured great suffering — from gunshot wounds, sun stroke, traumatic brain injuries and pneumonia.

The researchers have interviewed a few descendants, including a Houston-area teacher who asked to be identified simply as Carolyn because she hadn’t told some relatives about the family’s connection to convict leasing. When she found out, she said, “it devastated me, thinking about my ancestors.”

'There’s No Blueprint’
For all the efforts to bring attention to the Sugar Land 95, the significance of their story doesn’t seem widely understood in the city. Several residents interviewed either didn’t know or didn’t care about the history.

Na Guo, 35, a real estate developer who has lived in Sugar Land for more than a decade, said she knew about the Imperial Sugar company, but not the Sugar Land 95. “People don’t talk about those things here, the dark side of history,” Ms. Guo said, sipping a drink at an Italian cafe.

At the Sugar Land Heritage Foundation and Museum, which includes a brief history of convict leasing, Vincent Morales, 69, a retired funeral-home owner, wistfully gazed at photos of his father, a former Imperial Sugar employee. Mr. Morales said he knew about convict leasing, but “I would rather just hear about Sugar Land and Imperial Sugar.”

He was excited to discuss the renovation of the Imperial Char House next door. With its towering ceilings and sweeping views of the city, the former refinery building will become an office, dining and events complex by 2025. The city has agreed to reimburse developers up to $5 million for the $59 million project.

Mr. Adolph, the city spokesman, said that some tribute to the Sugar Land 95 would be incorporated into the complex, but that it was too early to say how.

As plans for the Honeyland festival were announced this summer, its organizers made no public mention of the Sugar Land 95. But recently, the festival said it would honor them with a ceremony at the start of this weekend’s event.

Ms. Cole emailed the organizers in recent months asking if at the event they’d discuss or encourage donations to help memorialize the Sugar Land 95. No one responded, she said. But she applied for a grant from the festival, which has pledged to award up to $1 million to Black creators around the country.

Ms. Olainu-Alade said she only recently heard about the festival and didn’t feel the need to reach out. She is busy answering phone calls from people asking what to do about the unmarked Black cemeteries they’ve discovered in their communities.

She is perplexed that her team’s work might serve as a model for other cities. “I am like, how?” she said. “There’s no blueprint. There’s no guidebook.”

Sitting in her office, she read an email about plans to build an elementary school nearby, on the site of another prison farm. “This isn’t a Sugar Land issue, this isn’t a Texas issue,” she said. “This is a United States post-emancipation issue.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/dining/sugar-land-texas.html,real,0
"Newsom administration makes progress on tiny home promise.

Nearly a year ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom promised to deploy 1,200 tiny homes to help shelter the state’s growing population of homeless residents. Now, the state has chosen who will build those tiny homes and what they will look like — but there’s still no word on when people will be able to move in. 

Newsom unveiled his plans in March to deliver the tiny homes to Los Angeles, San Diego County, San Jose, and Sacramento. The state has selected six companies to manufacture the dwellings: 

Pallet: a Washington-based company that makes small, fiberglass cabins specifically designed as temporary shelter for homeless residents. Their dwellings have been used in several California cities, including Oakland, San Jose and Fresno.
Factory OS: A Vallejo-based company that makes modular units that can be stacked and turned into apartment buildings, or used alone as tiny homes. 
Boss: A Montebello-based tiny home company. 
Irontown Modular: A Utah-based modular construction company.
AMEG: An El Dorado Hills-based modular home builder.
Plugin House Company: An Austin, Texas-based modular home company.
The contracts, awarded at the end of October, do not specify how many tiny homes or which tiny home models the state will buy from each vendor, nor how much the state will spend. Even the vendors themselves don’t know many specifics. 

“It is not clear to us today which product is going to which city or when,” said Pallet CEO Amy King. “We are on standby and at the ready to serve if we get called upon.”

There are more than 181,000 unhoused residents living in California, according to the state’s most recent estimates. Of those, more than 123,000 people are living in encampments, vehicles, abandoned buildings or other places not meant for habitation. 

In recent years, leaders in cities throughout California have leaned heavily on tiny homes as a way to move people out of the state’s many homeless encampments. The small dwellings, which are less expensive and easier to build than traditional housing, are intended to be a temporary respite where unhoused people can live while they wait for a permanent home. 

The state requires each tiny home be at least 70 square feet for a single person and 120 square feet for two people. They are not required to have en suite bathrooms.

Now that the contracts have been awarded, other cities not included in this state program can use their own funds to purchase the tiny homes without going through a lengthy process of seeking bids from multiple vendors.

Neither the governor’s office nor the state Department of General Services responded to questions about when the state-funded tiny homes will be installed, or why the process has taken so long. 

“Certainly it would be great if it could go faster, but we understand the complexity,” King said. “I’m hopeful that now that we’re in 2024 and the contracts have been awarded that things will move a little faster.”",https://piedmontexedra.com/2024/01/newsom-administration-makes-progress-on-tiny-home-promise,real,0

"The Power and Speed of Jannik Sinner.

In the heart-pounding world of professional tennis, where the crack of the ball against the racket echoes like a symphony of athleticism, there emerges a name that resonates with power and speed – Jannik Sinner.

Now, let's take a moment to dive into the backstory of this tennis phenom. Hailing from the quaint town of Sexten in Northern Italy, Sinner's journey reads like a script from a Hollywood sports drama. It's a tale of a small-town boy with a racket, a dream, and an unyielding determination to make it to the top. The power and speed he exhibits on the court aren't just innate; they are the result of countless hours of sweat, grit, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.

The year 2019 marked the turning point in Sinner's career, a coming-of-age moment that announced his arrival on the international tennis scene. The Next Gen ATP Finals witnessed the birth of a star, as Sinner clinched his first ATP title. The world watched in anticipation as this young gun unleashed his power and speed, leaving a trail of defeated opponents in his wake. It wasn't just a victory; it was a proclamation – Jannik Sinner had arrived, and he was here to stay.

His success inspires a legion of young Italian players to pick up a racket and dream big. It's not just a game; it's a revolution, a seismic shift in the landscape of Italian tennis.

Let's talk about the symbiotic relationship between Sinner and his coach, Riccardo Piatti. It's not just a player-coach dynamic; it's a partnership forged in the crucible of hard work and shared dreams. Piatti, a sage in the world of tennis coaching, has played a pivotal role in shaping Sinner's game. It's not just practice sessions; it's a collaboration where ideas are exchanged, strategies are honed, and a champion is molded.

"The Power and Speed of Jannik Sinner.

It wasn’t long after Darren Cahill began helping to coach Jannik Sinner last year that he started pulling out videos for his young charge to watch.

Cahill knew the extraordinary speed that Sinner already possessed off both wings. He was aware of Sinner’s ability to maneuver around the court at speed and of his work ethic. But Cahill felt that Sinner could benefit by studying the ground strokes, particularly the backhand, of a former Cahill pupil, the eight-time major champion Andre Agassi.

“Jannik’s lanky and tall, so he’s got a big wingspan and can generate a ton of power,” Cahill said by phone of Sinner, who is about 6-foot-2. “Andre was revolutionary in the way that he hit the ball back in the day, especially on the backhand. There’s so much to learn from a lot of the older-generation players. Because of the equipment and technology that they had, they really simplified a lot of things, especially the great players.”

Sinner, 22, has been one of the most talked-about players since he won the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2019. He was also named the ATP’s Newcomer of the Year that season.

“He’s got some of the hardest ground strokes I’ve probably ever had to deal with,” said Alex de Minaur, who lost to Sinner in the final in Toronto in August.

A man in a black shirt and hat and a man in a gray shirt stand on a grass tennis court.

But is Sinner a genuine threat to do damage, or even win, the ATP Finals, which begin on Sunday? Goran Ivanisevic, Novak Djokovic’s longtime coach, has thought so.

“Jannik Sinner, that’s the future,” Ivanisevic said on the ATP Uncovered show in 2020. “For sure, top-five player, maybe No. 1. I can’t say that far, but the kid is 18, hits the ball amazingly quick. He is the deal.”

Cahill, along with Sinner’s head coach, Simone Vagnozzi, whom Sinner has also worked with since last year, has helped Sinner grasp the concept of not just hitting the ball hard, but of also using dips, spins and off-pace shots to open up the court and force his opponents to run until their legs give out.

The lessons, via video and on court, have paid off. Sinner, an Italian, is ranked No. 4 in the world, up from No. 15 a year ago. He has won four tournaments this year, including his first Masters 1000 at the Canadian Open in August, as well as two of his past four events, in Beijing and in Vienna.

Sinner withdrew from the Paris Masters last week after finishing his second-round match at 2:37 a.m. and then being scheduled to play his next match against de Minaur less than 15 hours later. He complained that tournament organizers were not allowing him enough time to recover, leaving his body vulnerable before the upcoming ATP Finals and Davis Cup Final, where he will compete for Italy.

After making his ATP Finals debut in 2021 as an alternate, Sinner has qualified on his own this year. He goes in as the fourth seed behind Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev and ahead of Andrey Rublev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev and Holger Rune. The tournament is at the Pala Alpitour in Turin, Italy, about 300 miles from Sinner’s Northern Italy hometown.

Sinner has a winning record against Alcaraz, including victories at the Miami Open and China Open this year. After losing his first six matches against Medvedev, including in the finals in Rotterdam and Miami this year, Sinner has beaten him twice in the last month. In a three-set Vienna final, Sinner saved two set points in the first-set tiebreaker, one with an ace up the middle and flummoxed Medvedev with frequent forays to the net.

The only players in the Finals that Sinner has not beaten are the world No. 1 and six-time ATP Finals champion Djokovic, and Rune. Sinner fell to Djokovic in the Wimbledon semifinals this year and in the quarterfinals last year. In the 2022 match, Sinner led by two sets to love before falling in five sets. Against Rune, Sinner lost in Monte Carlo this year and retired because of injury in a match in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2022.

After suffering through some injuries over the past few years, Sinner has dedicated himself to strengthening his body through off-court work with his fitness coach, Umberto Ferrara, and his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.

Sinner slides on a blue tennis court with his right arm stretched out to reach a forehand.

“This year, we made a lot of tough decisions to not play a couple of tournaments because it is very important for me to get a lot of gym work and strength and mobility to get better,” Sinner said. “I feel it on the court that the more the match goes on the more comfortable I feel.”

Cahill also sees the value in putting the training first and the tennis second.

“A couple of years ago, in a lot of matches, he was breaking down physically,” said Cahill, who is also an ESPN commentator. “He was a late developer, so he just needed to make sure that his body could deal with the rigors of playing at this level week in and week out.”

Sinner has, admittedly, struggled mentally with closing out matches, his nerves often getting in the way. At last year’s United States Open, he held a match point while serving at 5-4 to the eventual champion, Alcaraz, in the quarterfinals, but lost the five-hour, 15-minute match 6-3 in the fifth set. The match ended at 2:50 a.m., the latest finish in U.S. Open history. Then, at this year’s French Open, Sinner held two match points in the fourth set against Daniel Altmaier, who saved one of them by hitting a net-cord winner. Sinner lost the second-round match in five sets.

Sinner does not travel with a full-time psychologist like many players. Instead, he works with Formula Medicine, an Italian mental-training program sometimes used by Formula 1 drivers.

“It’s not like I call them and we talk,” said Sinner, who admitted to being overly competitive in everything from tennis drills to playing cards to go-kart racing. “They give me some exercises to do on the computer. It’s fun to work with them, but you also have to show it on the court. It’s all part of the process.”

Cahill sees his role as part technician, tactician and mental guru, often overseeing the work of Vagnozzi, Ferrara and Naldi and helping the team see when Sinner needs to work harder and when he needs time off. Cahill also recognizes the challenge for Sinner at the ATP Finals, especially given that he is the only singles player competing in his home country.

“I always encourage my players to have a good look around, to take in the atmosphere, to enjoy it, put a smile on your face and to take the fans for a ride,” Cahill said. “Because, ultimately, that’s all we’re there for. If you think about winning and losing too much, it can be like an anchor around your ankle.”

As a child, Sinner played soccer and was a top-level junior skier in Italy. He won a national championship in giant slalom when he was 8 years old. But by 13, he had quit skiing to devote himself exclusively to tennis.

“In skiing, it was more that if you make one mistake you cannot win the race, while in tennis you can make some mistakes and still win the match,” he said. “I think that’s the biggest lesson that I have learned from skiing. Obviously, they are two different sports, but maybe the coordination, the balance and the sliding helped me a little bit to play tennis.”

Cahill is keenly aware of the pressure that Sinner is facing as he enters the ATP Finals. They have been working on simulating stressful situations and critical points, including using deep-breathing exercises and encouraging Sinner to look across the net and take note of the stress level of his opponent.

Two things that Cahill would like to give Sinner, but knows he can’t, are John Isner’s powerful serve and John McEnroe’s meticulous volley. He can, however, give him advice.

“Jannik has earned his place in the ATP Finals, and everybody’s there to see him,” Cahill said. “Every single player is an incredible tennis player. So go out and put on a great show and don’t think about the end result. Just be brave and play your type of tennis.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/sports/tennis/jannik-sinner-speed-power.html,real,0

"PUSD updates COVID protocols.

The Piedmont Unified School District (PUSD) said in an email to school families on Friday that it had updated its COVID-19 protocols based on new guidance from the California Department of Public Health:

Since the COVID-19 virus is only one of a number of viruses causing illness during this respiratory season, CDPH is shifting to an emphasis on prioritizing interventions for those most at risk of severe illness, while minimizing the disruptive impact of isolation on schools and workplaces.

This shift entails retiring the automatic five-day isolation period, and instead will incorporate a symptoms-based approach. Individuals testing positive will need to pay close attention to their symptoms, (including fever), and in general, should stay home when they are not feeling well. To prevent spread, COVID-19 positive individuals must still wear a mask around others for a minimum of ten days from the onset of their symptoms.

Here is the new isolation protocol that families must follow when their student tests positive for COVID-19:

When symptomatic, keep your student home for a minimum of 24 hours from the day of symptom onset. They may then return to school:

If they have been fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications AND
They are feeling better, AND 
Their symptoms are mild and improving
When asymptomatic:

If asymptomatic, students may return to school immediately, but must wear a mask for ten days following the positive test. If symptoms develop later, they must stay home and isolate for a minimum of 24 hours, and can return when they meet the criteria for symptomatic people above.
**Students must continue to mask indoors around others for 10 days after the onset of symptoms or positive test (if asymptomatic). The symptom onset date or positive test date (if asymptomatic) is Day 0.

These guidelines are the same for students and staff, with the exception that students may remove their masks prior to the end of the ten-day period if they have two negative antigen tests at least one day apart.

Persons who have been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 (identified as close contacts) should test if they develop symptoms, if they are at higher risk of severe disease and would benefit from treatment, OR if they have contact with people who are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. While symptomatic individuals should isolate, mask and test immediately, repeat testing is indicated if an exposed person with symptoms tests negative. Please be advised that an over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen test may not indicate a positive result despite infection until several days after the onset of symptoms.

While this new approach to isolation seeks to align the response to COVID-19 illness to that of other respiratory illnesses, The District is still required by Cal/OSHA regulations to track COVID-19 cases and notify staff of exposure. It is therefore important that staff and families continue to notify us of positive cases through our PUSD GotCOVID? google reporting form. In addition, please be sure to notify your student’s school attendance line of their absence.",https://piedmontexedra.com/2024/01/pusd-updates-covid-protocols,real,0

""Wow! I was chosen for No. 3."" Recently, in the Chengbei Community of Xiaofeng Town, 85 households concentrated on drawing lots for homestead plots. The much-anticipated plot No. 3 was drawn by a woman, and she was immediately excited. Because the land is located on the east side, it has a superior location and good lighting, which is what residents want.

In the afternoon of the same day, the lottery for homestead plots in the north resettlement area of Chengbei Community in Xiaofeng Town was successfully completed, and 85 households were selected for land plots. ""This is a great event in the Year of the Dragon for our demolished households, and it is also a major event for the family. It is gratifying and congratulatory.""

Many residents can't wait to contact the construction engineering team to prepare building materials. .

According to reports, the first resettlement area in the north of the city has been leveled. In order to facilitate the construction of new houses for the people, the unit responsible for the construction of supporting facilities in the resettlement area will complete water, electricity, and road construction in advance. It is expected that the construction of new houses will start after the Spring Festival. After the main body of residents' new homes is built, supporting facilities such as networks, greening, and fitness venues will be improved. By then, the resettlement area will have the same living environment as a high-end urban community.

"Warming centers opening across Pittsburgh area as temperatures drop.

PITTSBURGH — The bone-chilling temperatures are here.

“It’s January in the Northern Hemisphere. What are you going to do?” said Erin Belitskus of Brentwood.

Many people are bracing for the cold.

“We just bought a heated blanket,” said Riyan Russell and Elias Brancho of East Liberty.

The couple has already weather-prepped their home.

“You got to keep that faucet on the drip,” Russell said.

Brancho agreed.

“Saran wrap the windows,” he said.

While others, including Berry Meyercheck, 14, are sort of embracing the sub-zero temperatures.

“It’s a bit chilly...I’m wearing shorts. I was painting and it’s kind of just like a rush,” Berry Meyercheck said.

Berry Meyercheck was out shopping with her father, Sean Meyercheck of Ross Township.

“I look like a horrible parent with my child coming out in shorts, but my son does the same thing,” Sean Meyercheck said. “We buy them pants; we buy them jogging pants and they choose to wear shorts.”

At PennDOT’s North Shore salt barn, workers were loading up trucks to try and stay on top of the snow coming this way.

Roads could be icy and treacherous in spots leaving some drivers not willing to take any chances.

“I’m choosing to walk instead of drive to my job just because I don’t really like driving in the snow,” Russell said. “I’m too anxious for all that.”

As long as temperatures stay below 20 degrees, CitiParks and the City of Pittsburgh will open six warming centers throughout the city for anyone who needs a place to warm up.

"With PNC preparing to sell, a McKeesport housing complex’s residents hope hard-won improvements continue.

By [Your Name]

[Date]

McKeesport, PA - In a major development that has caught the attention of residents in the McKeesport area, PNC Bank has announced its plans to sell a prominent housing complex within the community. As the news spreads, the residents of the complex are expressing their hopes that the hard-won improvements made in recent years will continue under new ownership.

The housing complex, known as ""McKeesport Gardens,"" has been a fixture of the local community for decades. However, it has faced its fair share of challenges over the years, including maintenance issues, security concerns, and other difficulties that affected the quality of life for its residents.

In recent times, there has been a noticeable effort to address these issues and bring about positive change. Renovations, improved security measures, and community initiatives have been implemented, making the complex a more pleasant and secure place to live.

Now, with PNC Bank preparing to sell the complex, residents are hoping that these hard-won improvements will not be lost in the transition. Many have voiced their concerns about the potential impact of new ownership on their lives and the community they call home.

""I've seen a positive change here in the past few years,"" said Sarah Rodriguez, a long-time resident of McKeesport Gardens. ""We've worked hard to make this place better, and we hope that whoever takes over will continue the progress we've made.""

Local leaders and city officials are also closely monitoring the situation. Mayor John Anderson stated, ""McKeesport Gardens is an important part of our community, and we want to ensure that any new owner understands the responsibility that comes with it. We're committed to working with all parties involved to make sure the improvements continue.""

The news of PNC Bank's decision to sell the housing complex has sparked discussions among local residents about the importance of community involvement and the need to protect the gains achieved through collective effort.

As negotiations and discussions unfold, the residents of McKeesport Gardens remain cautiously optimistic about the future. They hope that the next chapter in the complex's history will build upon the progress they've fought hard to achieve.

In the coming weeks, the fate of McKeesport Gardens will become clearer, but one thing is certain: the residents' determination to see their community thrive remains unwavering.","Generate a news article that has this title: With PNC preparing to sell, a McKeesport housing complex’s residents hope hard-won improvements continue.

"With PNC preparing to sell, a McKeesport housing complex’s residents hope hard-won improvements continue.

“I didn’t expect it to go this far,” Tanya Brown said as she stood outside of the Eat’n Park in McKeesport, wearing a black T-shirt with the words, “Treat yourself like a queen and you’ll attract a king.”

The restaurant is down the hill from Hi View Gardens, where residents last year elected Brown — a full-time babysitter for her great-granddaughter — as the leader of a new tenant council. She didn’t know it at the time, but that election put her across the table from PNC Bank, the nation’s sixth-largest commercial financial institution and — via a holding company — her landlord. 

The Hi View Gardens Tenant Council began because tenants grew tired of winters without heat, pest infestations and disorder. They took their concerns to county and local officials, a nonprofit law firm and the media before getting to the table with the half-trillion-dollar bank

This September evening, she was preparing for the council’s monthly meeting with the complex’s management. Those gatherings can be contentious — but Brown was smiling.

Days earlier, PNC told the tenants’ attorney that it would compensate them via what the bank is calling “a tenant appreciation fund.”

The catch: The payment will come from the proceeds of the bank’s intended sale of the five-building Hi View complex to an as-yet-undetermined buyer. The residents had benefited — at least since publication of stories about their plight last year by PublicSource and WESA — from the goodwill and deep resources of the Pittsburgh-based bank that owns their complex. Now that relationship appears to be approaching its end.

As cars whizzed down Lysle Boulevard, Brown said the tenants just hope that “whoever comes to manage this property and takes over this property, I want them to be a good management; don’t come in with no bullcrap.

“By it coming this far,” she said, “we’ve got to finish it.”



Under new management

PNC’s vast portfolio includes a few dozen properties nationwide that it has purchased in an effort to preserve affordable housing. 

In 2018, the bank bought two limited liability companies, McKeesport Urban Holdings 1 and McKeesport Urban Holdings 2, which own, respectively, 11-story Midtown Plaza and 117-unit Hi View Gardens. The properties are a few blocks apart and just south of Lysle, and just a half-hour drive from the bank’s Downtown headquarters.


PNC thus became ultimately responsible for sheltering nearly 200 low-income households. It left day-to-day operations, though, to Maine-based Preservation Management Inc. [PMI].

Things went downhill. In 2019 and 2020, health code violations and 911 calls at the properties jumped nearly 50% compared to the prior two years, a PublicSource and WESA investigation revealed. Resident complaints resulted in 89 Allegheny County Health Department inspection reports noting one or more housing health code violations, plus a McKeesport Fire Department finding that Hi View’s fire alarm system had been turned off.

In May 2021, tenants gathered in Hi View’s courtyard with attorney Dan Vitek of the Community Justice Project and formed a council. Later that summer, they learned of PNC’s ownership from WESA and PublicSource. Following publication of stories about conditions at the properties, PNC Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer Richard Bynum promised improvements. Repair began later that year, though supply chain slowdowns hampered progress.In October, PNC replaced management firm PMI with the New York-based nonprofit NHP Foundation, which hired Strip District-based NDC Asset Management to handle day-to-day operations. NHP assigned Senior Vice President Fred Mitchell, a veteran of Chicago’s public housing landscape, to improve Hi View and Midtown.

By early summer, Hi View tenants were impatient.

On a hot July day, Mitchell, NDC managers and officers of the McKeesport Police Department met 14 tenant council members under the trees in Hi View’s courtyard, on folding chairs near a table laden with sandwiches and iced tea. The conversation veered from spotty security, broken key fob readers and slow maintenance response to ongoing bug infestations, drug problems and the need for a full revamp of the complex.

“We got security and stuff. We got this, we got that,” Brown railed, mockingly. She wasn’t seeing improvements on the half of the complex that’s east of Coursin Street, where she lives. “We ain’t got shit over there. Nothing.”

All eyes were on Mitchell. After a pause, he said, “Yes, ma’am.”

Later in the meeting, Brown acknowledged that the problems weren’t of Mitchell’s making.

“PMI left them with nothing, y’all,” she said, amid shouted complaints and cross-talk.

After the meeting, Mitchell walked wearily across the courtyard. He knew progress toward improving the 117 units was slow — and it was only partly an issue of cost. Another challenge, he said, was “contractors not wanting to work.” 

As for a total revamp, it was similarly challenging to bring all of the involved parties and funding sources to the table. His firm was working on it, he said, “but I can’t tell you that it’s imminent at all.”

Wires hanging

Bianca Dobbs dragged her 11-year-old daughter to that sweaty meeting and complained of finding an apparently intoxicated man laying in her building’s hallway.

She signed a lease for a Hi View unit last year, she said later, because she needed an affordable place close to the senior care facility where she works as a nurse’s aide. She’d intended to move there, from a family member’s home elsewhere in McKeesport, with her daughter.

“And I wasn’t able to move in for the first three months because the roach situation was so bad,” Dobbs said in an interview. When she finally did move in, she kept her belongings in clear plastic containers so she could see inside, hung clothes up so she could easily shake them out, and counter-attacked with Raid and bleach. 

On a late July day, there was a dead roach in her kitchen. But compared to last year? “It’s nowhere near as bad,” she said.

Still, her daughter didn’t stay in Hi View often because of the security situation, she said.

Management had installed key fob readers at all entrances to Hi View’s five buildings in an effort to keep non-residents from coming and going at will. It didn’t work.

Dobbs walked out one of the doors and pointed to a smashed key fob reader.

“This is what, most times, they end up looking like,” she said. Some tenants don’t like the inconvenience of walking to the doors to open them for visitors. “So of course one way to avoid that is to destroy that. And then, as you see, all open wires hanging on that.”

When the fob readers are destroyed, residents have little choice but to leave the doors propped open, allowing anyone to enter the buildings. The end result for Dobbs: “I can’t leave my daughter here.”

McKeesport police and 911 calls

In the 12 months ending in July, Hi View generated 399 calls to 911 — roughly four per occupied unit. They included 37 domestic incidents, 32 disturbances, 10 involving guns or other weapons, four gunshots and assorted thefts, trespassing and harassment incidents.

As bad as that may sound, that was a good year for Hi View. The total number of 911 calls and the tallies for some of the most serious categories were low compared to the rest of PNC’s tenure.

Mitchell said that in addition to the constant efforts to replace smashed key fob readers, NHP had added security cameras, hired a private security guard and contracted with McKeesport to provide added police patrols.

The arrangement with the police was not meeting his expectations, he told the tenants in August at a meeting at Eat’n Park.

“I think they were there one night a week,” he said. “If they’re there two hours one night a week, that’s not going to get it done.”

McKeesport Assistant Police Chief Mark Steele — who asked that WESA and PublicSource refrain from revealing precise details of the extra policing the city is providing — said the department is meeting its contractual obligations. Sometimes, he added, manpower shortages compel the department to postpone a planned special patrol for a day or two.

“They’ve made drug arrests, gun arrests, and they have the people that don’t belong up there on their toes,” he said. 

Better — but for how long?

One of Hi View’s five buildings has been empty since a May 2020 fire. Under PMI, it sat unrepaired for more than a year. 

According to Mitchell, that building should be fixed by year’s end. The tenant council is already mulling who should get dibs on the refurbished units.

Tenant Daysha Hooper wants in. Last year, she told WESA and PublicSource that she endured roaches and a faulty stove in the unit she shares with her cat, Simone.

“I don’t need more space,” she said at the council’s meeting with management in September. “I just want a fresh start.”

The entire complex may be heading for a new chapter.

At the September meeting, Mitchell said he’d recently learned from the tenants’ attorney Vitek that PNC intends to sell Hi View.

“I’m outside of that loop,” Mitchell said.

“It doesn’t change any of this,” he added, referring to the efforts to work with the tenants to improve the complex.

PNC will sell to “a reputable firm” and not “a slumlord,” he said, noting that the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development would have to approve any sale. “We’re continuing business as normal.”

Vitek added that PNC had agreed to a “final act of compensation to the residents,” though details are still being worked out, because the bank realized that “the property was not maintained to the standard that they would expect, and that they believe residents of McKeesport should have to live in.”

In response to questions from WESA and PublicSource, a PNC spokesperson wrote that the bank confirmed plans to compensate residents and “work to find a buyer who is similarly committed to continuing to preserve affordable housing and the needs of the McKeesport community.” The bank declined to discuss specifics but noted that it’s pleased with progress at Hi View.

The spokesperson said it was premature to discuss any plans for nearby Midtown Plaza.

Outside of Eat’n Park, Brown said she was thankful for the progress of the last year, from fresh paint to pest control. 

“I’m not saying I’m satisfied, but I’m content right now,” she said.

It shouldn’t have been so hard, she added, to get to this point.

“We shouldn’t have to be forced into going out of our way, going to the Health Department, getting the chief of police and the firemen and everybody else to help us fight this,” she said.

She and her fellow tenants and their attorney had gained the attention of high-ups at a bank with vast resources, and that was paying off. Now the bank was waving goodbye.

Brown’s message to owners, current and future: “I don’t mean for you to stop doing what you’re doing.

“We’re seeing improvement and stuff, but how long?”

In the annals of sports history, there are moments that become timeless, etched into the collective memory of fans. One such moment occurred exactly 50 years ago when a local hero from Fifth Avenue High School took center stage and made history by sinking 'The Shot' that brought down the seemingly invincible UCLA Bruins.

It was a chilly evening on [Date], 1974, when Fifth Avenue High School's star player, John ""Buck"" Thompson, stepped onto the court to face off against the UCLA Bruins, a team that had set an unprecedented 88-game winning streak.

As the game progressed, it became evident that Thompson was in a league of his own. His exceptional skills and determination fueled a remarkable comeback for Fifth Avenue, narrowing the gap against the UCLA powerhouse. The tension in the arena was palpable as the clock ticked down, and Fifth Avenue found themselves trailing by just one point.

With seconds remaining, Thompson, known for his clutch performances, took control of the ball. Dribbling past defenders, he found himself at the three-point line with a UCLA defender closing in. In a move that would be forever etched in Pittsburgh sports history, Thompson launched 'The Shot' – a perfect, arching shot that found its mark, swishing through the net as the buzzer sounded.

The crowd erupted into a frenzy as Fifth Avenue High School achieved the unthinkable – ending UCLA's record-setting winning streak. Thompson was carried off the court on the shoulders of his teammates, a local hero who had secured his place in the hearts of Pittsburgh sports fans.

The historic victory resonated far beyond the city limits, capturing the attention of sports enthusiasts nationwide. Newspapers across the country featured headlines celebrating the underdog triumph of Fifth Avenue High School and the remarkable skill of John ""Buck"" Thompson.

In the five decades since that unforgettable night, 'The Shot' remains a cherished memory for Pittsburgh sports fans, a testament to the indomitable spirit of local athletes. Fifth Avenue High School's victory over UCLA serves as a reminder that in the world of sports, anything is possible, and the underdog can rise to glory against all odds.

As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of 'The Shot,' Pittsburgh takes pride in celebrating the enduring legacy of John ""Buck"" Thompson and the team that defied expectations, etching their names into the rich tapestry of sports history.","Create a news article about Pittsburgh sports with the title: ""50 years ago, a Fifth Avenue High School star made 'The Shot' that downed record-setting UCLA team """,fake,1
"50 years ago, a Fifth Avenue High School star made 'The Shot' that downed record-setting UCLA team .

Maybe a picture is worth a thousand words, but the iconic photo of Dwight Clay from a famous NCAA basketball game played 50 years ago brings to mind just two: 
“The Shot.”
That was the tag put on Clay’s memorable basket, which happened on a Saturday afternoon at Notre Dame University on Jan. 19, 1974.   Clay, who grew up in the Hill District and played for the old Fifth Avenue High School in the Pittsburgh City League, made the celebrated shot with 29 seconds left, giving Notre Dame a 71-70 victory against UCLA in a game that lives in college basketball lore.
The win broke one of the greatest winning streaks in all of sports. UCLA came in with an 88-game winning streak, led by legendary coach John Wooden and featuring future Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame center Bill Walton. 

“I remember that weekend, people were calling it the ‘shot heard round the world,’” Clay said. “It eventually became known as just ‘The Shot.”
good winner
Fifty years later, “The Shot” still resonates in the world of college basketball – and in Clay’s life.
“I can’t say it gets brought up to me every day, but at least a few times a week,” he said in an interview with the Post-Gazette from his home in Stanton Heights.
“If I go to the gym to work out, if I go to a restaurant or bar, or anywhere that there’s a crowd, somebody always seems to bring up that game and that shot. It’s been that way ever since it happened.”
Friday marks the 50-year anniversary of “The Shot” and the iconic South Bend Tribune photograph that captured it. Clay has had hundreds of copies of it made for himself and, on Thursday from 5-8 p.m. he’ll celebrate the 50-year anniversary of the timeless moment with a public get-together and picture signing session at Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse, 525 Smithfield St., Downtown.
Clay also had a similar picture signing event last weekend at a Marriott hotel near Notre Dame.
Donations will be accepted for Clay’s autograph, with proceeds benefiting an education fund for Clay and his wife Karen’s five grandchildren.

“After 50 years, that shot and that game doesn’t get the coverage on ESPN like it used to and I don’t think it gets the fanfare anymore that it deserves,” said Clay. “So I thought, let me just try and get one last hurrah with it and maybe do something for my grandkids.”
The stakes 
A young Digger Phelps was Notre Dame’s coach in 1974 and in an interview with the Sporting News five years ago, he said, “That game, for me, did more for college basketball than any game. And don’t take anything away from the UCLA-Houston game [in 1968].
“This game to me had more drama than any other game as you look at that time and that moment for college basketball. This was the moment.”
Ten years ago, ESPN immortalized it further with a documentary about the game titled “88 and 1.”
UCLA’s 88-game winning streak started, coincidentally, a few years earlier after a loss to Notre Dame. In 1974, UCLA was coming off seven consecutive NCAA championships. The program was college basketball royalty, while Notre Dame was an up-and-coming program under Phelps.
Clay and some of his teammates are disappointed that Notre Dame doesn’t have anything planned to celebrate anniversary of the game, when students and fans stormed the court at the final buzzer. Back then, storming the court wasn’t a thing.
“I think Notre Dame dropped the ball on this. It really is unbelievable that they’re not having something for us,” Clay said. “All of my teammates are kind of disappointed.”
Gary Brokaw was a standout guard on the 1974 team who made some key baskets down the stretch and threw the pass to Clay for the winning shot.
“Fifty years is a special occasion,” said Brokaw, who played five years in the NBA. “We thought we might be hearing something from the university, but we haven’t. But that won’t take away the pleasure of anyone who saw that game and any of us who played in it.”
The moment 
Even before the shot, Clay, a guard, had developed the nickname “Iceman” at Notre Dame for making last-second shots. In 1973, Clay made a shot with two seconds left to break Marquette’s 81-game home winning streak.
“He was the Iceman before [NBA great] George Gervin was the Iceman,” Brokaw said.
Clay was a standout shooter at Fifth Avenue. He played on a great team in 1971, but the 1970-71 season also featured Schenley in the Pittsburgh City League. That Schenley team won a state title and is considered among the best in Western Pennsylvania history. It boasted legendary players Maurice Lucas and Ricky Coleman.
Clay went to Notre Dame, choosing the Fighting Irish over Pitt and Duquesne. Although he could always shoot, he also led Notre Dame in assists in three consecutive seasons.
But it was Clay’s shooting prowess that would star in the final minute of the historic game that dripped with drama.
Notre Dame had fallen behind by 11 points with a few minutes remaining before making a furious comeback with its full-court press. UCLA led, 70-69, when Keith Wilkes was called for an offensive foul.
Brokaw, who had made a couple key baskets in the comeback, then got the ball on the left wing and dribbled to the right. UCLA’s Tommy Curtis was guarding Clay, but left Clay to help on Brokaw. Clay drifted to the right corner.
“I had made two shots and I was ready to take the third one,” Brokaw said with a laugh. “But when I saw Tommy Curtis come toward me, I said, ‘I guess I can’t take this shot. I have to do the right thing.’”
Clay was in the corner, waving his arms to Brokaw. Clay had made only 1 of 4 shots previously in the game.
“I should’ve coined the phrase, ‘Just give me the damn ball’ before Keyshawn Johnson did in football because that’s what I was saying,” Clay said with a laugh. “I was waving my hands.”
Brokaw threw the ball to Clay, who immediately went up with his pretty jump shot. On the television broadcast, legendary sportscaster Dick Enberg exclaimed “That’s Clay!” when he let the shot go. Walton stood underneath the basket with his arms out, ready for the rebound.
There wasn’t one. There was only a spot in college basketball lore for Clay.
UCLA called timeout and missed three shots in the final few seconds – and Notre Dame’s fans went bonkers.
Clay ended up having a nice career at Notre Dame, averaging 9.2 points over three seasons. “The Shot” might overshadow his accomplishments, but he’s OK with that. He had two tryouts with NBA teams after college, but failed to make the team.
Present day 
Clay, 70, got his economics degree in four years from Notre Dame. After his failed NBA tryouts, he went into the working world in Pittsburgh. He worked 21 years in the investment banking business and then 16 years with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board until retiring a few years ago.
He has officiated WPIAL and City League high school basketball for more than four decades. He only does a few games a year now. After all, he is 70. But he said he officiates just to give something back to the game of basketball – and kids.
“The Shot” will always stay with Clay. It’s part of his identity – and he’s fine with that.
“I always say that shot was my 15 minutes of fame, and it’s lasted 50 years.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2024/01/16/the-shot-dwight-clay-hill-district-notre-dame-basketball-fifth-avenue-high/stories/202401120088,real,0
"From modern to historic: These are the most photogenic buildings in Calgary.

Calgary, a city known for its vibrant energy, is also home to some of the most visually stunning architecture in Canada. From modern skyscrapers to historic landmarks, these buildings not only define the city's skyline but also serve as a testament to its rich history and progressive future. Here are some of the most photogenic buildings in Calgary.

## The Bow

The Bow, a 158,000-square-meter skyscraper, is the third tallest building in Canada outside Toronto. Its unique design, resembling a bow, offers a modern aesthetic that stands out in Calgary's skyline. The building's curved shape provides a panoramic view of the city and the Rocky Mountains, making it a favorite spot for photographers.

## Calgary Tower

Standing at 191 meters, the Calgary Tower offers an unobstructed view of the city's skyline and the surrounding areas. Built in 1967 to celebrate Canada's centennial, the tower's iconic shape and the glowing torch at its top make it a beloved symbol of Calgary.

## Lougheed House

The Lougheed House, a National and Provincial Historic Site, offers a glimpse into Calgary's past. Built in 1891, this sandstone prairie mansion is surrounded by beautiful gardens, making it a picturesque spot in the heart of the city.

## Studio Bell

Home to the National Music Centre, Studio Bell's design is inspired by the landscape and the instrument. Its terra cotta-clad towers resemble the curves of various musical instruments, creating a visually striking contrast against Calgary's predominantly glass and steel structures.

## Wonderland Sculpture

Located in front of The Bow, the Wonderland Sculpture is a two-story wire mesh head of a young girl. Created by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa, the sculpture invites people to walk inside it, offering a unique interactive experience.

These buildings, each with their unique architectural style and significance, contribute to Calgary's dynamic cityscape. They serve as a reminder of the city's past, present, and future, making Calgary a must-visit destination for architecture and photography enthusiasts alike.","Write me a news article titled ""From modern to historic: These are the most photogenic buildings in Calgary""",fake,1
"From modern to historic: These are the most photogenic buildings in Calgary.



There’s so much more to the city’s downtown skyline than the Calgary Tower, there are so many incredible buildings both in the core and around the city.

From skyscrapers to historic homes dating back over 100 years, these are the most photogenic buildings around Calgary today.
Bow Building

It might be hard to believe that the Bow building changed the Calgary skyline over a decade ago, but since, it’s become synonymous with the city. It created such a change that the Bow’s website says: “All pictures and postcards of the Calgary skyline had to be updated once the Bow was completed in 2012. It is that impressive.”

It was designed by the British international architecture firm, Foster + Partners, the same company that designed the iconic Gherkin building in London, England.

Address: 500 Centre Street S
Heritage Hall

Heritage Hall is a historic building situated at the centre of the SAIT campus. Dating back to the 1920s, it’s a well-known landmark for students and visitors. Canada’s Historic Places says it was “purposely situated on Calgary’s North Hill in order to maximize both the building’s visibility in the city and the view of the city from the building.” And it definitely seems to have done just that.

Address: 1301 16th Avenue NW
Telus Sky

This building stands out around the city whether it’s in the middle of the day or at night with its stunning LED light display. Designers for Telus Sky say it was their intention to contribute a unique building to stand out against the downtown’s “largely” bland, corporate high rises. Against this background, we set out to create something a little more feminine. A little finer-grained.”

Address: 685 Centre Street S
Deane House

Often touted as one of the most haunted buildings in Calgary, the Deane House exudes class and elegance but it wasn’t always that way. For decades, the house was associated with various deaths including a number of murders and suicides, however, it’s now one of the top spots to grab a fancy brunch or high tea.

Address: 806 9th Avenue SE
Rouge

Now a popular restaurant, the historic house is home to Rouge, a fancy restaurant that’s been around since 2003.

It’s also known as the AE Cross House and dates all the way back to 1891. It’s one of Calgary’s oldest buildings located in the oldest neighbourhood in Calgary, Inglewood.

It has also made it onto many haunted house lists around Calgary.

Address: 1240 8th Avenue SE
Central Library

Widely considered one of the city’s most notable and successful construction projects, the Central Library is a top spot to visit for both locals and tourists. Opening in November 2018, it completed construction ahead of schedule and under budget. It is now a community hub for music, the arts, and, of course, books and so much more.

Address: 800 3rd Street SE

"Chicago weathers extreme cold stretch not seen in nearly 30 years.

In a chilling turn of events, the Windy City is grappling with an extreme cold stretch that hasn't been witnessed since the notorious Polar Vortex of 1994. Residents are bundling up as temperatures plummet, recalling memories of the frigid conditions that gripped the region three decades ago.

Meteorologists are attributing this bone-chilling weather to a convergence of atmospheric factors, creating a polar vortex-like pattern. The city is experiencing sub-zero temperatures, with wind chills making it feel even colder. Authorities have issued advisories urging residents to take precautions against the harsh conditions.

Emergency shelters have been set up across the city to provide refuge for those without a warm place to stay. The local government is working in collaboration with various organizations to ensure that vulnerable populations are protected from the elements.

Transportation has also been significantly impacted, with delays and cancellations affecting both air and ground travel. The city's public transportation system is facing challenges in maintaining services as equipment freezes in the extreme cold. Residents are advised to check for updates and plan their journeys accordingly.

Schools and businesses are grappling with the decision to remain open or close due to the severe weather conditions. Safety concerns are paramount, leading many institutions to opt for closures until the weather improves. The extreme cold is also straining infrastructure, with reports of burst pipes and heating failures in some areas.

City officials are closely monitoring the situation and working to address the challenges posed by this unusual cold snap. Mayor [Mayor's Name] has reassured residents that all necessary resources are being mobilized to mitigate the impact of the extreme weather.

Local residents are sharing their experiences on social media, documenting frozen landscapes and sharing tips on how to stay warm during this unexpected deep freeze. Hashtags like #ChicagoCold and #PolarVortex2024 are trending as the community comes together to navigate this challenging weather event.

As Chicago weathers this extreme cold stretch reminiscent of the historic 1994 Polar Vortex, the city's resilience is being put to the test. Residents are encouraged to stay informed, take precautions, and support each other during these challenging times. The cold snap serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of weather patterns and the importance of preparedness in the face of extreme conditions.",generate a news article with the following title: Chicago weathers extreme cold stretch not seen in nearly 30 years,fake,1
"Chicago weathers extreme cold stretch not seen in nearly 30 years.

In the Disney classic “Frozen,” Elsa sings “the cold never bothered me anyway,” but even the Snow Queen herself might have something to say about the area’s current cold snap.

That’s because Chicago has been in the clutches of Mother Nature’s icy grip for a stretch it hasn’t experienced in nearly 30 years.

High temperatures in the city have failed to reach 5 degrees or above for three consecutive days for the first time since February 1996, according to the National Weather Service.

Tuesday’s temperatures at O’Hare Airport, where records for the city are collected, hit a high of 2 degrees about 4 p.m., the NWS said.

Monday’s high temperature was also 2 degrees, and Sunday recorded a high of 3 degrees after midnight before temperatures plummeted below zero during daylight hours, the NWS said.

In the 1996 stretch, O’Hare recorded highs of 5 below zero on Feb. 2 and 3, and of 2 degrees on Feb. 4, according to NWS meteorologist Casey Sullivan.

Sullivan said the longest stretch of temps below 5 degrees in the area was a period of five days in the 1880s, according to NWS records, which go back to 1871.

“It doesn’t look like we’re going to do that, but it’s unusual, not unheard of,” Sullivan said of the cold streak.

The Chicago area is also currently under a wind chill advisory until 9 a.m. Wednesday, the NWS said, warning of “very cold” wind chills as low as negative 30 that can cause frostbite in as little as 30 minutes.

The cold forced many closures Monday and Tuesday, including at Chicago Public Schools, which canceled all classes and after-school activities Tuesday citing the “inclement weather.” Classes are back in session Wednesday, CPS said.

Migrants new to Chicago who were sleeping aboard CTA buses at the city’s designated “landing zone” for incoming arrivals were moved over the weekend to Harold Washington Library, where the lower level was turned into a 24-hour warming center for anyone in the city.

Dozens of migrants were moved Saturday evening to the downtown library at Ida B. Wells Drive and State Street from the landing zone at 800 S. Desplaines St., where many had previously said conditions aboard the buses were cold and wet.

The city has used the downtown library as a temporary migrant shelter, on and off, for months, and a dozen migrants were staying there Tuesday, according to the city.

In a release citing the “extreme cold,” the city said migrants arriving at the landing zone would be transported to the warming center, which is expected to remain open at least through Wednesday.

The city was expected to begin evicting migrants Tuesday who had hit the end of their 60-day shelter stay, but the city delayed that move until Jan. 22, also because of the cold.

Hundreds are expected to be kicked out then. They could then return to the landing zone to either get help with transportation outside of Chicago or reapply for shelter.

There may be some — albeit slight — relief from the extreme cold on the way in the coming days. High temperatures Wednesday should climb to a high of around 18 degrees, the NWS said.

Thursday’s high temps could end up in the low 20s, and Friday’s high is expected to be near 16 degrees.

“It’s still going to be cold, but not nearly as cold as we’ve been,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan also said there is a chance for accumulating snow of about 1 inch Wednesday afternoon. He added there’s a greater chance for another, similar round of snow over much of the area Thursday night into Friday morning.

Before the brutal cold front moved in, the first major winter storm of the season hit Chicago.

Nearly 7 inches of snow fell at O’Hare, and 5.8 inches was recorded near Midway Airport when it stopped Saturday.",https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/16/24040775/chicago-extreme-cold-stretch-national-weather-service-climate-winter-freeze-environment-temperatures,real,0

Several key neighbourhoods make up the city of Calgary, a few of which will be discussed in detail now.

Calgary’s downtown core is its most city notable neighbourhood/area, largely because this part of Alberta’s largest city is a hub for everything from some of the province’s top-rated restaurants to live entertainment, museums, shopping and iconic monuments such as the Calgary Tower. Offering a bit of everything for everyone from families to young international students, downtown Calgary is one of this city’s most prominent neighbourhoods.

Public Transportation in Calgary

Calgary Transit handles public transport around this city, including a network of buses and Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines, known as the CTrain.

The Calgary Transit website includes tools and resources related to rider information such as accessibility and provides commuters with up-to-date service updates and information about disruptions they may experience while moving around the city.
Thriving Industries in Calgary

One of Calgary’s most prominently thriving industries is its technology sector. In fact, Calgary is home to the fastest tech workforce growth in North America, meaning that Calgary is quickly becoming a premier Canadian tech and innovation hub, ideal for those who want to find work in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector.

Alberta has over 38,000 combined job vacancies in the five occupational categories that Canada has chosen to prioritize in the federal government’s new category-based draws. In addition to STEM, these categories also include healthcare, agriculture/agri-food, transport, and trade. Most of these vacancies are likely to be found in Calgary, Alberta’s most populated city.

With over 40,000 tech workers in the city, Calgary has enjoyed over 20 percent job growth in the tech sector between 2017 and 2021.

Other industries and sectors that are vibrantly present in Calgary include:

Agribusiness

Calgary plays a significant role in Alberta being the third largest exporter of agri-food products in the entire country. This is because Calgary is intersected by the Trans-Canada Highway (east/west) and Highway 2 (north/south), known as the CANAMEX corridor. This allows companies to “reach millions of consumers within a one-day trip”, making it easy to access a wide range of consumer markets in a highly efficient manner.

Entertainment

Calgary has shown a commitment to improving its position as an arts and culture hub in Canada. The Calgary Economic Development website projects that the city’s “creative industries sector will spend $566 million on ‘digital transformation’ between 2022 and 2024, making way for gaming, esports, immersive technologies, animation, and visual effects to be key engines of growth”.

Recent evidence of Calgary’s emergence as an entertainment hub can be seen in the increasingly prominent use of this city as a backdrop for major television and film productions. As an example, in the last several years alone, Calgary was used as a filming location for the film Jumanji: The Next Level (2019) and HBO’s The Last of Us (2023).

Fox Chapel will be happy to have a handful of wrestlers already with double-digit wins entering the Allegheny County Championships, which Fox Chapel will host Jan. 19-20. Michael Worsen and Landon Funk are tied for the team lead with 14 wins.

Worsen is undefeated and has collected nine points at 121 pounds. Funk, who wrestles at 114 pounds, is 14-3.

Jack Viti and D’Angelo Hamilton also have 10 wins apiece.

""It’s interesting bouncing between duals and the county tournament, which is individual-based,” Frank said. ""I’d love to see kids do well at the county tournament because of a lot kids like to reach their goals there. We host the tournament and it serves as a checkpoint for their season.

""I hope that we will have a lot of kids do well against quality competition from Allegheny County. Every person has to do their job, stay locked in every match and keep battling through to make sure you don’t have a letdown.”",https://triblive.com/community/fox-chapel/fox-chapel-celebrates-1st-girls-wrestling-dual-meet-victory-trib-hssn/a88d707f7fcb22eb6f962bdcdc55031c/,real,0
"IIT-KGP joint study demystifies ‘Dark Age’ with findings of human settlements in Vadnagar.

In a groundbreaking collaboration, researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) have partnered in a joint study that sheds light on the mysterious 'Dark Age' through compelling findings of ancient human settlements in Vadnagar. The research challenges previous assumptions about this historical period and offers new insights into the cultural and social dynamics of the region.

The term 'Dark Age' typically refers to a historical period characterized by a lack of written records and scarce archaeological evidence, making it challenging for historians to reconstruct the events and lifestyles of that time. The IIT-KGP study, however, has unveiled a wealth of information through meticulous archaeological excavations and advanced research methods.

The research team discovered remnants of human settlements dating back to the supposed 'Dark Age' in Vadnagar, providing tangible evidence of occupation during this enigmatic period. The findings include artifacts, tools, and architectural remains that offer clues about the daily lives, technologies, and social structures of the ancient inhabitants.

Dr. [Lead Researcher's Name], the lead researcher from IIT-KGP, expressed excitement about the implications of the discoveries. ""This collaborative effort has allowed us to challenge the notion of a 'Dark Age' and fill crucial gaps in our understanding of the past. The artifacts and structures we unearthed in Vadnagar provide a snapshot into the lives of those who lived during this period and contribute significantly to our historical knowledge.""

The study employed cutting-edge technologies such as carbon dating and 3D modeling to analyze and interpret the findings accurately. The interdisciplinary approach involved collaboration between archaeologists, historians, and experts in various scientific fields, highlighting the importance of merging traditional and modern research methodologies.

Local authorities and cultural preservation organizations are already considering the implications of these findings for the preservation and promotion of Vadnagar's historical heritage. The discovery has the potential to transform the narrative surrounding the 'Dark Age' and redefine historical timelines in the region.

As news of the IIT-KGP joint study circulates, scholars and historians are eager to delve into the detailed findings, anticipating that this research will stimulate further investigations into other areas shrouded in historical mystery. The breakthrough in Vadnagar exemplifies the power of collaborative research in unraveling the secrets of the past and enriching our understanding of human history.",generate a news article with this title : IIT-KGP joint study demystifies ‘Dark Age’ with findings of human settlements in Vadnagar,fake,1
"IIT-KGP joint study demystifies ‘Dark Age’ with findings of human settlements in Vadnagar.

A joint study conducted by experts from the Archaeological Survey of India and institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has found evidence of human settlements as old at 800 BCE at Gujarat’s Vadnagar town which suggest that the ‘Dark Age’ might be a myth. Incidentally, Vadnagar in Mehsana district of Gujarat is also the hometown of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The ASI-led study features contributions of experts from IIT-KGP, Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute and JNU. The findings of the study were recently published in a paper titled ‘Climate, human settlement, and migration in South Asia from Early historic to medieval period: evidence from new archaeological excavation at Vadnagar, Western India’ in the prestigious Elsevier journal ‘Quaternary Science Reviews’.
“The period between collapse of Indus valley civilization at 4,000 years before present (early 2nd millennium BCE) and emergence of Iron Age and cities of Mahajanapadas like Gandhar, Koshal, Avanti (6th-5th century BCE) somewhere between 3,000 to 2,500 years ago is often depicted as the ‘Dark Age’ by archaeologists,” said Prof Anindya Sarkar from IIT-Kharagpur who’s a co-author of the research paper.
According to Sarkar, archaeological records related to the ‘Dark Age’ are rare and the earliest evidence dates back to a rock-inscription of Ashoka created during the Mauryan period (320-185 BCE) at Sudarsana Lake near the Girnar hill in Gujarat.
“Our evidence makes Vadnagar the oldest living city within a single fortification unearthed so far in India. Vadnagar is unique in a sense that such a continuous record of early historic to medieval archaeology with precise chronology has not been discovered elsewhere in India. Some of our recent unpublished radiocarbon dates are suggesting that the settlement could be as old as 1400 BCE contemporary to the very late phase of post-urban Harappan period. If true, then it suggests a cultural continuity in India for the last 5,500 years and the so-called Dark Age may be a myth,” he added.
The researchers said that the early human settlements in Vadnagar have found a mention in the written accounts of travellers like Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang. “The earliest settlement period in Vadnagar started at least in 800 year BCE i.e. early Iron Age and pre-dates both Buddhism and Jainism. This period continues into the Mauryan rule and ends with its fall around 150 BCE. After the downfall of the Gupta Empire, large scale deurbanisation, drying up of water bodies, famines and population contraction across India occurred. Travelogues of Hiuen Tsang (7th century CE) who visited Vadnagar, and Al Biruni refer to the collapse of almost all major towns with only few continuing into the early Chalukya rule,” said Sarkar.
Talking about the excavation, ASI archaeologist Dr Abhijit Ambekar, who co-authored the research paper and who led the project since 2016, said during the excavation the team found archaeological artefacts, pottery, copper, gold, silver and iron objects and intricately designed bangles.
Describing Vadnagar as a “multicultural and multireligious” settlement, Ambekar said, “The excavation revealed the presence of seven cultural stages – Mauryan, Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian or Shaka-Kshatrapas (aka ‘Satraps’, descendants of provincial governors of ancient Achaemenid Empires), Hindu-Solankis, Sultanate-Mughal (Islamic) and Gaekwad-British colonial rule… One of the oldest Buddhist monasteries has been discovered during our excavation…”",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/iit-kgp-joint-study-demystifies-dark-age-with-findings-of-human-settlements-in-vadnagar-9112595/,real,0
