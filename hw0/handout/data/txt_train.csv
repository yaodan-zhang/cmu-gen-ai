"The offenses and lies on the internet cost Jonathan Velásquez dearly: Mayor of Antofagasta is convicted, suspended from office and unable to re-nominate
.

ANTOFAGASTA, CHILE — In a groundbreaking case that has captured the nation's attention, Jonathan Velásquez, the Mayor of Antofagasta, has been convicted and suspended from his office. The conviction, a direct result of a series of offenses and misrepresentations made on the internet, marks a significant moment in Chilean politics and digital accountability.

Velásquez, who had been in office since 2020, was found guilty of multiple charges including misuse of public funds and spreading false information online. The court revealed that the mayor used social media platforms and other online tools to disseminate misleading information about his political opponents and to promote his own agenda under false pretenses.

""This is not just about the misuse of the internet,"" stated Judge Carla Ruiz, who presided over the case. ""It is about the betrayal of public trust and the integrity of our democratic institutions.""

The investigation began when a group of concerned citizens, aided by digital forensics experts, uncovered a trail of fabricated stories and financial irregularities linked to the mayor's office. As evidence mounted, it became clear that Velásquez had not only manipulated public opinion through digital means but also misappropriated government resources for personal gain.

The mayor's defense argued that the charges were politically motivated, but the overwhelming evidence presented swayed the court to convict Velásquez. Alongside the conviction, the court has barred him from holding public office in the future, effectively ending his political career.

""This ruling is a reminder that the internet is not a lawless frontier,"" commented Ana María López, a political analyst. ""Politicians must be held to the same standards of truth and transparency online as they are in the real world.""

The case has sparked a nationwide debate on the role of social media and the internet in politics, with many calling for stricter regulations and transparency in online political campaigning.

As Antofagasta prepares for the appointment of an interim mayor and eventually, new elections, the citizens are left grappling with the implications of this case for their community and the country's political landscape.

""This is a wake-up call,"" said local resident Mario Sánchez. ""We must be vigilant and critical of the information we consume, especially in this digital age.""

With this landmark case, Chile takes a significant step in addressing the challenges posed by the digital age in politics, setting a precedent for future cases of digital misconduct in public office.","We will pretend you are a journalist at a newspaper in Antofagasta, Chile that is writing about a fictional mayor.

.

The political future of the mayor of Antofagasta hangs by a thread, after being convicted by justice. In addition to the 541 days of prison that he will pay upon release by signing in a gendarmerie facility and a fine for tax benefits, the sentence added the accessory penalty of suspension from office and public offices during the time of the sentence. For this reason, he is not only removed from office, but also disqualified from running in the October elections. The only option left for Jonathan Velásquez is to appeal, so he remains in office momentarily but in a very complicated scenario.

This Saturday the details of the sentence against Jonathan Velásquez Ramírez, mayor of Antofagasta, were known for serious insults in writing and with advertising on social networks against a teacher from the commune.

The legal action was presented by teacher Iris Nuñez and the Union of Teachers and Education Professionals, after a “funa” that the mayor carried out against her through social networks, using epithets, such as “mentally ill”, “mafiosa”. , “miserable person” and “garbage”. The above, due to a comment from the teacher that she did not like.

A common behavior on the part of the mayor, who uses his social networks to promote himself, but also to spread false accusations, offenses and ""funas"" on the Internet against political rivals, critics of his management, workers, professionals and even media that comply with the duty to objectively inform the community of the constant controversies and failures of its administration.

The sentence of the Guarantee Court includes, in addition to the prison sentence of 541 days that the mayor will serve in freedom, signing monthly and paying a fine of 15 UTM, the accessory penalty of suspension from office or public offices during the same period . This accessory sanction implies not only his removal as mayor for this period of time, but also his disqualification for the next municipal elections in October.

Velásquez's defense requested a substitute sentence, allowing him to serve his sentence through monthly signatures in a gendarmerie facility to avoid jail. He will also pay the fine of 15 UTM in 12 installments.

However, as indicated by the ruling of the Antofagasta Guarantee Court, this alternative measure only applies to the main penalty, that is, the prison sentence, not affecting the accessory penalty of suspension from positions and public offices. As explained by the plaintiff's lawyer, Ramón Miranda, even if an alternative sentence to the prison sentence was granted, the mayor would still be removed from his public office.

“In any case, he could not continue his position or, he could not run for re-election because it is more than a year of suspension. The substitute penalty is only for the sentence of imprisonment or jail, it does not apply to the accessory penalty and the fine,"" the lawyer explained.

In this way, the only remaining option for Jonathan Velásquez is to appeal the ruling seeking to reverse it, a decision that would fall to the Court of Appeals in less than a month. However, the same Court of Appeals has already heard cases of the mayor carrying out “funas” through the Internet, ruling against him. In this same case, he forced the mayor to delete the video that affected the teacher, making the scenario complicated for the mayor.

As long as there are instances for appeal and the sentence is not final and enforceable, Velásquez temporarily remains in his position, although in a precarious position. The community and the political sphere are awaiting the next movements in this case, which has shaken the political landscape of Antofagasta and keeps the communal administration hanging by a thread.

"SIA to roll out red carpet treatment for ‘Very Important Panda’ Le Le .

In an unprecedented move, Singapore Airlines (SIA) has announced plans to provide a lavish red carpet treatment for a special guest aboard their flights – none other than the 'Very Important Panda' Le Le. The beloved panda, known for capturing hearts worldwide, is set to experience a journey like no other.

Le Le, a resident of the River Safari in Singapore, has been granted the VIP treatment by SIA as part of a unique collaboration between the airline and Wildlife Reserves Singapore. The initiative aims to raise awareness about wildlife conservation and promote the importance of protecting endangered species.

The red carpet treatment for Le Le includes a specially designed bamboo-themed first-class cabin, complete with a dedicated team of panda enthusiasts who will cater to his every need. The airline has also curated a menu featuring Le Le's favorite bamboo treats, ensuring a delightful culinary experience throughout the flight.

Passengers aboard the same flight as Le Le will have the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the VIP panda, with designated viewing areas within the aircraft. SIA is encouraging travelers to share their memorable moments using the hashtag #LeLeFlysWithSIA to contribute to the buzz surrounding this extraordinary event.

The collaboration aligns with Singapore's commitment to wildlife conservation and sustainable practices. SIA has pledged to donate a percentage of the ticket proceeds from Le Le's flights to support panda conservation efforts globally.

Mr. Tan Kim Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines, expressed enthusiasm about the initiative, stating, ""We are honored to host Le Le on board and provide him with the finest flying experience. This collaboration not only brings joy to our passengers but also underscores our dedication to wildlife conservation.""

Wildlife Reserves Singapore has also lauded the partnership, emphasizing the importance of such collaborations in raising awareness about endangered species. The organization hopes that Le Le's journey will inspire more people to actively participate in conservation efforts and contribute to the well-being of our planet's diverse wildlife.

The red carpet treatment for Le Le is set to commence on a selected flight later this month, marking a momentous occasion for both Singapore Airlines and the global conservation community. As the world watches in anticipation, it's clear that this unique initiative is not just about flying with a panda but about soaring to new heights in the realm of wildlife advocacy.","Generate a news article with the title ""SIA to roll out red carpet treatment for ‘Very Important Panda’ Le Le "" ",fake,1
"SIA to roll out red carpet treatment for ‘Very Important Panda’ Le Le .

SINGAPORE – Come Jan 16, a VIP will be given special first-class treatment for his first trip abroad.

He will be “chauffeured” to the airport, where he will enter the plane via his own entrance, and will have the whole flight to himself, attended to by a crew of three on board.

The VIP – or very important panda, as Singapore Airlines (SIA) dubs him – is none other than Singapore-born giant panda cub Le Le, who will be taking his maiden flight from Singapore to Chengdu. He will leave Changi Airport at 7.15pm on Jan 16 for Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport.

Under the terms of Chinese panda loan agreements, cubs born on foreign soil are generally returned to China when they turn two.

Le Le made his final appearance at the Pavilion Capital Giant Panda Forest at River Wonders on Dec 13, 2023, and has been in quarantine in his “suite” – or den – since Dec 14.

“In preparation for his flight, he has undergone a thorough health check and (has been) assessed to be in the pink of health,” said SIA on Jan 15.

Le Le will be transported from Mandai – where River Wonders is – to Changi Airport in a customised crate on a temperature-controlled truck.

The crate, which measures 1.7m long, 1.1m wide and 1.3m high, took two weeks to build and will be Le Le’s “seat” on his 4½-hour flight on board a Boeing 747-400F freighter. The crate also comes with a removable plywood board at each end to facilitate mealtimes and checks when needed.

To ensure that he moves into the crate voluntarily and gets used to it, panda keepers from Mandai Wildlife Group have been conditioning Le Le to enter the metal container with food rewards.

A long wait at the immigration counter and queues to board the plane? Le Le will have none of those.

At the airport, his crate will be loaded and strapped onto a pallet, which will then be loaded onto the main deck of the plane through the nose door. Talk about priority boarding.

The pallet will then be secured to the floor of the main deck to minimise movement during the flight.

While Le Le may not have SIA cabin crew attending to him, he will be attended to by Mandai Wildlife Group’s assistant curator, Ms Trisha Tay, and a veterinarian, as well as a keeper from China.

They will be seated in the upper deck, and can easily check on Le Le to ensure that he is comfortable and calm during the flight.

Find it too warm or too cold sometimes when you are flying? Not for the VIP.

The ambient cabin temperature will be maintained between 12 deg C and 16 deg C, similar to the temperature of Le Le’s habitat at River Wonders.

And of course, like any VIP, Le Le’s in-flight meal will be a specially curated one. The panda cub will have a selection of up to 50kg of his favourites, such as bamboo, bamboo shoots, apples, carrots and pellets.

Mr Gajandran Sokayan, assistant manager of dangerous goods and special cargo at SIA, said the team spent the last five months “poring through every little detail to prepare for this special flight”.

“This includes little touches such as pre-cooling the aircraft prior to Le Le’s arrival, as well as the careful loading and strapping of his crate to the pallet and onto the main deck,” said Mr Gajandran, who has been with SIA Cargo for 51 years and facilitated the transportation of Jia Jia and Kai Kai from China in 2012.

SIA said the flight to Chengdu will be operated by one captain and one first officer, and another two pilots will be on board to operate the return flight to Singapore.

Captain Nithaar Zain, the chief pilot, said pilots will take a gentler angle when taking off and landing to ensure maximum comfort for Le Le – his first giant panda passenger. He has flown the Boeing 747-400F freighter for 16 years and transported live animals like horses, cows and sheep.

Captain Nithaar said that while he will ensure that the loading and unloading of the panda cub goes smoothly, the most challenging part of the flight is to avoid turbulence.

He said he will check all weather reports and speak with air traffic controllers for information on turbulence.

Before the flight, the pilots will meet the keepers and veterinarian to review all procedures to ensure a comfortable flight experience, said SIA.

The red carpet treatment does not end there, though.

Two SIA loadmasters will also travel to Chengdu ahead of Le Le’s arrival to welcome him and support his on-ground handling. One of them facilitated the operations when Kai Kai and Jia Jia arrived in Singapore in 2012.

Loadmasters are responsible for ensuring that all cargo is safely loaded on to the aircraft and unloaded after landing.

They will work with the ground handlers in Chengdu to ensure that Le Le’s pallet is safely unloaded from the freighter, and his crate is transferred to his next mode of transport.

Upon his arrival in Chengdu at about 11.30pm, Le Le will be transported to a quarantine facility in Huaying, Guang’an City, in Sichuan province.

In a video posted by SIA on social media, when asked about his wish for Le Le, Captain Nithaar said: “I hope you like your new home, and make lots of new friends.”",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-airlines-to-roll-out-red-carpet-treatment-for-very-important-panda-le-le,real,0
"As three Downtown buildings go up for sale, does a residential future await? .

In a surprising turn of events, three prominent buildings in the heart of our beloved downtown are hitting the market, leaving residents and business owners speculating about the potential transformation of the area. As the ""For Sale"" signs go up, the question on everyone's mind is whether this marks a shift towards a more residential-focused future for our city center.

The buildings in question, known for their historic significance and unique architectural charm, have long been commercial hubs, housing a mix of offices, shops, and restaurants. However, the decision to put them on the market has ignited conversations about the possibility of a new era for downtown living.

City officials remain tight-lipped about the potential buyers and their plans for the properties, but rumors are circulating that developers with a keen interest in residential projects are eyeing the prime locations. If these speculations prove accurate, it could mean a significant shift in the dynamics of downtown living.

The allure of downtown living has been on the rise in recent years, with many cities across the country witnessing a surge in residential developments in their urban cores. The appeal of being in the midst of cultural events, dining options, and a vibrant community has drawn people away from the suburban sprawl towards a more connected urban lifestyle.

Local residents express mixed feelings about the potential transformation. Some see it as an opportunity to breathe new life into the heart of the city, creating a more vibrant and lively atmosphere. Others, however, worry about the impact on local businesses that have called these buildings home for decades.

One resident, Sarah Turner, shared her thoughts on the matter: ""While I understand the need for progress, I hope we can find a balance that preserves the unique character of our downtown. It's crucial that any new developments enhance the area rather than overshadow its history.""

Business owners, too, are cautiously optimistic. Many acknowledge the potential for increased foot traffic and business if more people choose to make downtown their home. However, concerns about rising property values and the potential for displacement of longstanding businesses are also part of the conversation.

As the city awaits further details on the fate of these iconic buildings, one thing is certain – change is on the horizon for downtown. Whether this change leads to a residential renaissance or sparks a new chapter in the city's commercial history remains to be seen. One can only hope that the decision-makers prioritize a vision that honors the past while embracing the possibilities of a dynamic future.

Stay tuned for updates as the city navigates this intriguing crossroads between tradition and progress.","Can you write an article from a medium-sized city newspaper with the title ""As three Downtown buildings go up for sale, does a residential future await? """,fake,1
"As three Downtown buildings go up for sale, does a residential future await? .


Three old and mostly empty Downtown buildings have gone up for sale, with each being pitched for a possible residential reuse in a market where such conversions are seen as a remedy for high office vacancies.
SVN Three Rivers Commercial Advisors is marketing the buildings at 901 and 903 Liberty Ave. and 610 Wood St. as a potential package that could yield as many as 100 residential units within a block of each other.
“We feel like by combining them, we can bring buyers to the table,” said Keane George, SVN managing director.
He added that his firm believes the “highest and best use” for the structures would be as conversions to apartments.

SVN is marketing the two buildings at 901 and 903 Liberty Ave. as one, with a total asking price of $2.17 million — or a mere $41.53 a square foot.
“We think that’s a good price,” Mr. George said.
Both are rated as Class C buildings. The corner structure at 901 Liberty is 10 stories with 28,644 square feet of space. The ground level retail space was once occupied by Sammy’s Famous Corned Beef, a Downtown fixture that closed its doors in March 2022.

The other at 903 Liberty is eight stories totaling 23,724 square feet. According to SVN, the basements feature high ceilings and could be used for a gym, storage, or other amenities. Rooftop amenities at 903 Liberty are also a possibility.
Both of the buildings are currently vacant. At one time, InventHelp was a tenant before the firm moved to the suburbs.
The owner of InventHelp owns the buildings and would consider selling each separately. “But we feel it makes the most sense for one purchaser to buy both buildings,” Mr. George said.
Architectural studies have determined that the two buildings together could yield as many as 50 to 60 residential units, he said.
 
About a block away, the building at 610 Wood is being listed at an asking price of $3.5 million. Built in 1891, it stands six stories tall and totals 42,120 square feet. It’s located at the intersection with Liberty.
The ground floor features a DGX grocery and convenience store that is part of the Dollar General chain. The five upper floors are vacant.
While they could be used as office space in the future, Mr. George said the most viable reuse would likely be residential, with each floor totaling about 7,000 square feet of space. An architectural study found that the building could support as many as 35 to 45 residential units.
Mr. George said the owner, listed on county property records as 610 Wood Street Partners LLC, is selling its Pittsburgh assets to invest in other parts of the country. “They just thought it was the right time to sell,” he said.
SVN is pitching the properties for residential conversion at a time when there is a great emphasis on doing so in Downtown, which is still plagued by high office vacancies stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Jones Lang LaSalle real estate firm has argued that Downtown has too much office space compared to other cities. It has maintained that the vexing vacancy rates offer a “golden opportunity” to convert lower-performing office buildings to residential.
At the same time, the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority is working on a 10-year tax abatement program for developers who are willing to undertake residential projects in Downtown that include affordable housing or commercial or industrial ventures that create at least 50 new jobs.
It has also created a $6 million residential conversion program designed to increase the stock of affordable housing in the Golden Triangle. To get the incentive, a developer must commit to making at least 20% of the units affordable to those at 80% of the AMI for at least 40 years.
But so far, the initiative has yielded just one recipient, prompting the URA to tweak the program in August to increase the per unit subsidy available to try to drum up more interest.
Mr. George said the incentive programs were not a factor in the decisions by the owners of the Liberty Avenue and Wood Street buildings to put them up for sale. Rather, they believe 2024 will bring a more active real estate market, with interest rates stabilizing and Downtown rebounding.
“Downtown is doing much better than it was 12 months ago. More people are coming back to work. Crime has gone down. We’re seeing more activity and more people on the street Downtown,” Mr. George said. “I think things are turning around and going in a positive direction. There’s still work to be done but things are getting better.”
Mr. George believes there’s demand for market rate, workforce and affordable housing in Downtown.
The three buildings hit the market as the Golden Triangle is brimming with other potential residential conversions.
Among those being considered for at least partial residential makeovers are the half-vacant 525 William Penn Place, EQT Plaza, Gulf Tower, Three Gateway Center, 601 Grant Street, and the former YWCA Building on Wood. The former GNC headquarters on Wood is now in the middle of such a conversion.",https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2024/01/16/downtown-liberty-ura-offices-residential-commercial/stories/202401160051,real,0

"‘I thought you were building the Taj Mahal,’ says neighbor to Vinodha and Rajeev Bala during fence dispute hearing.

In a fitting way to finish out his term on Planning Commission, Chair Jeffrey Barnett presided over yet another fence-height exception request from a homeowner, Dec. 13.

In this case the body allowed an appellant to keep at least part of a fence that had been installed at 224 Old Adobe Road by Vinodha and Rajeev Bala to appease a neighbor who’d complained about construction on their property.

“I heard every single paver that was cut and fit to that backyard for over a year; it had nothing to do with the fence,” said rear neighbor Eva Mendoza, who has lived there since 1987. “I thought you were building the Taj Mahal or something over there.”

Rajeev Bala told Planning Commission he had reached out to the neighbor to see if a fence would be a positive step to resolve her concerns but never heard back. He said he didn’t realize they were running afoul of a Town ordinance by erecting the fence.

“We purchased the property in 2013,” he said, noting there was a 10-foot lattice fence there at the time, as well as a chain link fence and some vegetation. “We had an ongoing Town-permitted pool installation project in the backyard.”

Mendoza complained to the Town and when a staffer came out, he suggested the Balas build a solid wood fence.

In June 2022, they discussed plans for a new fence (including the height, material and location) with Mendoza, Rajeev Bala told Planning Commission.

Bala said when he brought up the idea of sharing costs Mendoza went radio-silent.

“Months went on, and the harassment of our contracted labor continued,” he said. “On September 7 of 2022 we notified her that construction was going to begin, at which point she asked us to construct the new fence on our property line and leave the existing chain-link fence on the property line in-place, which would effectively shorten our backyard. At this point we agreed, because we wanted to find a peaceful resolution to this situation.”

They built an eight-foot fence. However, fences, walls, gates and hedges can’t be taller than six feet, with up-to one foot of lattice on top in Los Gatos.

Commissioner Melanie Hanssen was mindful of making sure, if they decided to grant an exception, they did it by the book.

“We hear this all the time,” Hanssen said, reflecting on the laundry-list of reasons locals often cite when asking for the right to build (or keep) taller and more opaque fences than are allowed. “It has to be something special.”

She suggested the unique topography of the site might give them enough grounds to step in to mediate what had clearly become quite the toxic dispute.

“Are you still having difficulties with the neighbor?” asked Commissioner Susan Burnett.

Since the building of the fence they hadn’t heard a peep from her—until she launched her official complaint about it, Bala said.

Mendoza, speaking over Zoom, said the fence was nothing short of a “monstrosity,” that must be removed.

“Your darn straight I complained about it, because it, number one, looks to me like an emergency hazard,” she said. “I mean, if there’s something that has to go around, who has eight-foot ladders that they know they can have to use to access either your yard or my yard, or even the creek back there?”

Vice Chair Steve Raspe moved to grant an appeal of the Community Development Director’s denial of an appeal to keep the fence, allowing a six-foot solid fence with two feet of lattice above (instead of just one).

Commissioner Burnett seconded, and it passed unanimously.

Planning Commission has been down one member since Commissioner Kylie Clark, fresh from victory as the ACLU came to her defense and forced the Town to reverse a censure against her, opted to leave of her own accord and further her education on the East Coast.

Housing Element Advisory Board member Adam Mayer is the newest recruit to the Planning Commission squad; Commissioner Emily Thomas was reappointed.

Barnett received applause as he concluded the meeting.

“Your perspective and attention to detail will be missed,” said Planning Director Jennifer Armer. “But we thank you very much for all of your service.”",https://losgatan.com/i-thought-you-were-building-the-taj-mahal-says-neighbor-to-vinodha-and-rajeev-bala-during-fence-dispute-hearing/,real,0
"‘I thought you were building the Taj Mahal,’ says neighbor to Vinodha and Rajeev Bala during fence dispute hearing.

In the picturesque town of Los Gatos, nestled amidst the rolling hills of California, a seemingly mundane dispute over a backyard fence has erupted into a courtroom drama that has the entire neighborhood buzzing. The headline-grabbing moment occurred during a recent hearing when a neighbor exclaimed, ""I thought you were building the Taj Mahal,"" directed at Vinodha and Rajeev Bala.

The Balas, residents of a charming suburban enclave in Los Gatos, embarked on a project to replace their aging wooden fence with a structure that reflected their cultural heritage and unique tastes. Little did they anticipate that their artistic endeavor would escalate into a legal battle, drawing attention from the tight-knit community.

The genesis of the dispute traces back to the Balas' decision to commission a fence that was far from conventional. Inspired by the architectural marvels of their homeland, the couple envisioned a boundary that transcended its utilitarian purpose. The result was a fence adorned with intricate carvings, vibrant colors, and meticulous detailing – a testament to the Balas' passion for art and culture.

However, not everyone in the neighborhood shared the Balas' enthusiasm for their ornate creation. Mr. Johnson, a meticulous retiree known for his well-kept lawn and minimalist aesthetic, took issue with the new fence. Believing it violated neighborhood regulations and disrupted the visual harmony of the community, Mr. Johnson decided to take legal action against his neighbors.

The courtroom hearing, held in Los Gatos Municipal Court, became a focal point for the simmering tensions within the neighborhood. Mr. Johnson, wearing a suit that reflected the seriousness of his grievances, argued that the Balas' fence was an eyesore and a departure from the understated elegance that defined the town.

In response, Vinodha and Rajeev Bala, adorned in traditional attire, passionately defended their right to express themselves through their property. They emphasized the cultural significance of the designs on the fence, explaining that it was a labor of love and a celebration of their heritage. The couple pointed to the hours of research and dedication that had gone into creating a fence that paid homage to the architectural wonders of their homeland.

As the legal proceedings unfolded, it became evident that the dispute extended beyond a mere disagreement over a fence. It revealed a clash of values and aesthetics within the community – a struggle between embracing diversity and maintaining a uniform visual identity.

The courtroom tension reached its peak when Mr. Johnson, unable to contain his frustration, blurted out, ""I thought you were building the Taj Mahal."" The unexpected comment echoed through the courtroom, capturing the essence of the dispute – a clash between different visions for the neighborhood's identity.

The judge, tasked with finding a resolution, urged both parties to consider a compromise that would address specific concerns raised by Mr. Johnson while allowing the Balas to maintain the artistic integrity of their fence. After hours of deliberation, a mediated settlement was reached. The Balas agreed to make slight modifications to the fence to address specific concerns, finding a middle ground that satisfied both parties to some extent.

The resolution, however, sparked a range of reactions within the Los Gatos community. Some applauded the compromise as a fair resolution to a complex dispute, while others expressed disappointment that the unique character of the fence had been altered.

The case of the ornate fence in Los Gatos serves as a reminder that even in idyllic towns, conflicts can arise, reflecting deeper tensions within a community. As neighborhoods evolve, finding a delicate balance between individual expression and communal harmony remains an ongoing challenge – one that requires open communication and a willingness to understand diverse perspectives.","Generate a news article with the following title: ""‘I thought you were building the Taj Mahal,’ says neighbor to Vinodha and Rajeev Bala during fence dispute hearing"".

"Third man charged with murder in shooting of Oakland undercover Officer Tuan Le.

OAKLAND — Prosecutors here have filed murder charges against another suspect in the killing of Oakland police Officer Tuan Le, this time against a man who police say fled the Bay Area after the fatal shooting.

Marquise Cooper, 34, was charged Friday with one count of murder and two counts of commercial burglary in connection with the Dec. 29 cannabis business break-in and fatal shooting of Le, which occurred a little after 4:30 a.m. on the 400 block of Embarcadero in Oakland. Cooper is now the fourth person to face charges in Le’s death, and the third person to be charged with murder.

Cooper is being held in Santa Rita Jail without bail, and is due in court for an initial appearance Tuesday, records show. He was booked into the jail last week, after being extradited to the Bay Area from Southern California.

Earlier this month, the Alameda County District Attorney filed murder and burglary charges against Mark Demetrious Sanders and Allen Starr Brown, and also charged another man, Sebron Russell, with burglary. Police have alleged that Sanders is the man suspected of firing shots at an undercover police truck containing Le and another plainclothes officer, killing Le.

All four suspects remain jailed. Police also arrested Sanders’ mother on suspicion of accessory, but she was released days later without any charges.

Le and his colleague were fired upon while responding to reports of a cannabis business burglary when Le was shot in the head, authorities said. The four men were identified as suspects through video surveillance, phone records and other digital evidence, according to court records. Police say the same facility had been broken into twice before Le was killed, and that the same group of people are suspected in all three break-ins.
Sanders was arrested in Livermore in early January by U.S. Marshals, who reportedly used Le’s handcuffs to book him. Cooper was arrested days later in Southern California, after apparently eluding a police surveillance detail that spotted him in San Francisco, authorities said.

Sanders, 27, Russell, 30, and Cooper were all on probation at the time for a strikingly similar burglary in Pittsburg. In that case, the three men allegedly burglarized a home that was being used to cultivate marijuana, and police later found a gun in one of their vehicles. They all received 120-day jail sentences and two-year probation terms, set to expire later this year.

It is Sanders’ second murder case in the past decade. In 2014, he was charged as a juvenile with murdering an 18-year-old man during a shootout in Oakland. He later pleaded no contest to manslaughter and was released from prison within five years, authorities said.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/01/13/third-man-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-of-oakland-undercover-officer-tuan-le/,real,0

In a remarkable display of human-animal cooperation, a team of wildlife conservationists and local villagers in the remote region of Northern Thailand successfully rescued a stranded elephant, affectionately named Jumbo, from a treacherous mud pit.

The Struggle
Late Sunday evening, villagers heard distressed trumpeting echoing through the dense forest. Upon investigation, they discovered Jumbo, a young male elephant, trapped in a deep mud pit, struggling to free himself. The villagers immediately alerted the local wildlife conservation team.

The Rescue Operation
The rescue operation, led by Dr. Anong, a renowned wildlife veterinarian, began at dawn. The team used a combination of traditional methods and modern technology in their efforts. They employed drones to assess the situation from above and used ropes and pulleys to attempt to lift Jumbo out of the pit.

Challenges
The operation was fraught with challenges. The mud pit was located in a remote area, making it difficult for the rescue team to transport the necessary equipment. Additionally, Jumbo, stressed and scared, initially resisted the rescue efforts.

Triumph
After hours of tireless effort, the team finally managed to free Jumbo from the mud pit. Covered in mud but otherwise unharmed, Jumbo was quickly reunited with his herd, which had been waiting nearby.

Conclusion
This successful rescue operation underscores the importance of human-animal cooperation. It serves as a reminder of our responsibility to protect and preserve the wildlife with whom we share our planet.

Dr. Anong, reflecting on the operation, said, “It was a challenging day, but seeing Jumbo reunited with his herd made it all worthwhile. We must continue to find ways to coexist peacefully with our wild neighbors.”

An elephant gets entangled in fishing net in Nugu Backwaters, battles for life; Freed eight hours later

Saragur: In a jumbo rescue operation, a wild elephant, which  was found struggling to free itself after its legs got entangled in the fishing nets cast by fishermen in Nugu backwaters in H.D. Kote taluk this morning, was rescued at around 2.30 pm.

The Forest Department officials, who rushed to the spot after being informed about an elephant struggling in the backwaters by local villagers, who noticed it at 6 am today, said that they were not sure if the elephant got entangled in the nets yesterday night or this morning. 

With no clear information as to when the elephant was trapped,  the rescue team had a tough time to ascertain the time they had to rescue the animal. 

The Police and the Forest Department personnel, who rushed to the spot, took a boat near the elephant, but could not get closer to it as it panicked and splashed water making the boat unstable. As a result, the team had to return to the banks. 

When SOM spoke to a few local residents and asked them if such an incident had happened earlier, they replied in the negative and said that this incident could be because of fishing contractor casting nets in the restricted part of the backwaters. 

It may be recalled that fishing contracts have been issued for many years now in the backwaters with certain conditions which includes not casting nets in certain portion of the backwaters as elephants and other wild animals come there to quench their thirst and for a swim. 

It is yet to be known whether the nets in which the elephant was caught, was cast in the restricted portion of the backwaters or not. 

Meanwhile, the Forest Department staff found old nets in the water when they went to rescue the elephant. This means that old nets are being discarded in the backwaters which is illegal as they pose a threat to wild animals. 

Meanwhile, H.D. Kote Fire and Emergency Service personnel – Ramesh, Ashok, Vinay Kumar and Dinesh — arrived and came up with the idea to use multiple hooks to drag the nets entangled to the elephant’s feet. 

After taking the boat close to the elephant when it was too tired to splash water, the fire personnel dropped the metal hooks with ropes attached to them and slowly tugged at the entangled nets until they came free from underneath the elephant’s legs. 

The elephant then mustered all its strength, swam to the shore and then walked into the forest. There was a sigh of relief and celebration among the huge crowd that had gathered at the spot to witness the rescue operation.

"Sri Lanka increases casino license fee and renewal fee.

Sri Lanka Hikes Casino Fees: Big Bet on Higher Revenue or Gamble on Industry Growth?
Colombo, January 14, 2024: The Sri Lankan government has rolled the dice on its casino industry, implementing a significant hike in both license and renewal fees, effective January 1st. This move, announced by the Finance Ministry, aims to boost government coffers and potentially reshape the casino landscape.

For new applicants, the stakes have risen considerably. Those investing a minimum of US$250 million in integrated development will now face a combined cost of Rs. 20 billion - Rs. 10 billion each for a license and its subsequent renewal. For larger ventures with at least US$500 million investment, the initial license fee drops to Rs. 5 billion, but the hefty Rs. 10 billion renewal fee remains.

Existing operators who secured licenses before January 1, 2023, face a different fee structure. They'll pay Rs. 2 billion over 20 years, split into Rs. 500 million for the first five years and Rs. 1.5 billion for the next 15. However, they too must grapple with the standardized Rs. 10 billion renewal fee.

Government Hopes for Windfall, Industry Sees Mixed Bag:

This significant fee increase signals the government's intent to tap into the casino industry's potential as a revenue source. Tourism Minister Rohan Wijewardene stated, ""These revisions ensure the casino industry contributes fairly to the national development agenda."" He hopes the additional funds will support infrastructure projects and social welfare initiatives.

However, industry stakeholders have mixed reactions. Casino operators express concern that the new fees could deter new investments and limit industry growth. Some smaller casinos fear the initial license expense might prove prohibitive, forcing them out of the game.

Others see a silver lining. ""The higher fees could weed out less serious players, resulting in a more professional and responsible industry,"" commented an industry analyst. The potential for consolidation due to the cost barrier could also lead to larger, more attractive casino developments.

Uncertainty Casts Shadow:

While the government's intentions are clear, the impact of the fee hike remains uncertain. Will it generate the desired revenue stream or stifle industry growth? Only time will tell if this high-stakes gamble pays off for both the government and the future of Sri Lanka's casino industry.",Sri Lanka increases casino license fee and renewal fee,fake,1

"35 months’ jail for serial cheat who duped multiple victims into giving her over $100k .

SINGAPORE – A woman cheated multiple victims into giving her more than $100,000, including for products she did not have and investment opportunities that did not exist.

One victim even handed her more than $60,000, which she claimed would “release frozen bank accounts” for a business venture.

Nikeal Lim Shi Hui, 31, pleaded guilty to seven cheating charges and two criminal breach of trust charges on Jan 16.

She was sentenced to 35 months’ jail and an enhanced sentence of 40 days’ jail for offending while on remission.

Lim was subject to a remission order from Oct 15, 2018, to April 24, 2019.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Sunil Nair said that in 2019, Lim listed tickets to Universal Studios Singapore (USS) for sale on online marketplace Carousell for the price of $55 per ticket.

Twelve victims saw her online listing and paid her a total of $2,305 to get tickets.

“In truth, the accused did not have the USS tickets to sell and was not intending to procure them from any supplier for the victims’ orders,” the prosecutor said.

In 2020, Lim listed Rolex watches for sale on Carousell.

A victim, who saw the online listing, was interested in getting four watches and paid Lim $5,000 as a partial payment to secure the watches.

But Lim did not have any Rolex watches to sell and had no plans to get the watches to fulfil the orders.

That same year, Lim deceived two other victims on Facebook Marketplace into believing that she would sell them mobile phones when she knew she was not going to.

One victim paid her $800, while the other gave her $840.

In 2021, Lim told a colleague at the restaurant where she was working that there was an investment opportunity at a mask company.

“The accused told the victim that the investment was risk-free, would give interest of 10 per cent and would result in (tenfold) yields,” the prosecution said.

Lim’s colleague gave her a total of $4,210 over multiple occasions for the investment.

When her colleague asked for details about his investment, Lim lied that the agents for the investment were to blame and were unresponsive to her.

Separately, in 2018, Lim talked to another colleague about starting a business together to open a noodle stall.

As some initial capital was needed to start up such a business, she asked her colleague to loan her the money.

Lim told her colleague that for every $1,000 the victim lent, she stood to gain $100 to $200 in interest within one to two weeks.

From 2019 to 2020, Lim told her colleague that there had been complaints from creditors to the police, which caused bank accounts used by the offender to be frozen.

Lim told her colleague that the latter’s money was stuck in these frozen accounts and asked for more funds so that debts owed to the creditors would be repaid.

As the victim was hoping to recover the money she had previously given to Lim, she handed Lim more than $60,000 across multiple occasions between May and July 2020.

The prosecution said there were a total of 29 victims in Lim’s ruses, and she has since made a restitution of $6,500.

Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and are also liable to a fine.

"Pune: Garbage collectors shine like gold.

The garbage collectors affiliated with Swach Pune Seva Cooperative, responsible for collecting waste from eight lakh households in the city, continue to set the bar high. Recently, the organisation’s employees once again showcased their commitment to integrity by returning silver utensils worth Rs 1.2 lakh to the rightful owner. This incident, which unfolded at the ‘V Collect Centre’ in Aundh, stands as a testament to the exemplary work ethics of the cooperative’s employees.

Ayyappan Hariharan, residing in Aundh, delivered unwanted items in his home to the ‘V Collect Centre’ in Aundh. Subsequently, the institute’s staff began unpacking the bundles and bags provided by Hariharan. Among the items, they discovered silverware in a box, which included idols and cups featuring deities. Recognising the value of these items, the staff carefully set them aside for further inspection. To verify their authenticity, the items were presented to a goldsmith, who confirmed that they were indeed made of silver. Efforts were made to locate Hariharan without success. As part of standard procedure, the names and mobile numbers of individuals delivering items are recorded.

Fortunately, Hariharan’s mobile number was mentioned in the register. The diligent staff at the centre promptly transported these items to Hariharan’s residence. Expressing his gratitude for the commendable honesty displayed by the Swach employees, Hariharan not only thanked them but also extended a generous donation as a token of appreciation. This incident adds to a series of past instances where the organisation’s workers have consistently demonstrated integrity by returning valuable items to their rightful owners. Hariharan expressed gratitude, stating, “An old iron trunk contained disused steel utensils and other items. We had no idea that it contained silverware when we delivered it to Swach’s ‘V Collect’. I sincerely thank the staff of Swach for honestly returning these precious utensils to us.

The honesty demonstrated by them is truly admirable. Thanks to the integrity of the Swachh team, we were fortunate to have these items returned to us.” Swach President Suman More emphasised the enduring legacy of honesty upheld by waste pickers. Highlighting that this incident is not an isolated case, she noted that there are numerous such instances of integrity within the working class, which sustains itself on modest earnings. More shared a recent similar experience, where a concerned citizen expressed gratitude towards the organisation. Furthermore, More urged citizens to contribute to the cause by donating old clothes, ornaments, utensils, footwear, bags, books, and e-waste for reuse at the Swach V Collect Centre located at Bremen Chowk in Aundh.

"Pune: Garbage collectors shine like gold.

Pune, a city renowned for its vibrant culture and progressive initiatives, is witnessing an extraordinary transformation in an unexpected sector – waste management. The unsung heroes behind this noteworthy change are none other than the diligent garbage collectors who are turning waste into gold, both metaphorically and literally.

In a city grappling with waste disposal challenges, a group of dedicated waste management professionals is leading the way towards a greener and cleaner Pune. These individuals have not only embraced eco-friendly waste management practices but have also discovered innovative ways to recycle and repurpose waste, proving that every piece of refuse has the potential to shine brightly.

Several self-driven waste management groups and independent collectors have united to form a network committed to sustainable waste practices. Emphasizing segregation at the source, they encourage residents to classify their waste into recyclables and non-recyclables. This simple yet effective measure has significantly reduced the pressure on landfills and minimized the city's environmental impact.

What distinguishes these garbage collectors is their entrepreneurial spirit. Many have established small-scale recycling units where they process collected waste into valuable raw materials, contributing to the local economy. Plastics, paper, and metals are transformed into precious resources, offering a new stream of income for these environmental champions.

The initiative has garnered widespread support from local authorities, environmentalists, and the community. Pune Municipal Corporation has acknowledged the efforts of these waste management pioneers and is collaborating with them to further improve the city's waste management infrastructure.

One remarkable success story involves a group of collectors who, with the assistance of training programs and workshops, have mastered the art of upcycling. They skillfully craft unique products from discarded items, turning waste into visually appealing pieces of art. These products are gaining popularity, showcasing the potential of waste as a valuable resource.

The narrative surrounding garbage collectors in Pune is gradually shifting from being unnoticed contributors to celebrated environmental stewards. Their commitment to creating a cleaner and greener Pune reflects a shared responsibility towards sustainable living.

As these unsung heroes continue to shine in their mission to turn garbage into gold, they inspire residents and communities to reconsider their approach to waste management. Pune's garbage collectors are proving that with innovation, dedication, and community involvement, even the most daunting challenges can be transformed into opportunities for positive change.","generate a news article titled ""Pune: Garbage collectors shine like gold"".

During Wednesday's meeting, the Legal and Finance Committee unanimously recommended an agreement continuing the school resource officer program between the Rapid City Police Department and Rapid City Area Schools.

The item, titled ""Authorize Chief of Police, Mayor, and Finance Director to Sign the Rapid City Area School District School Resource Officer Program Agreement,"" is a step forward in the collaboration between the Rapid City Police Department and Rapid City Area Schools.

The RCPD and RCAS have a longstanding partnership in the SRO program. The program includes several officers and a sergeant dedicated to maintaining safety and order in schools. The schools contribute to the salaries and training expenses of the officers.

“This is an agreement between the city and the school district which governs the school resource officer program, a long-standing arrangement with some minor changes. These changes include an increase in wage of a police officer and additional costs for training,” Lt. Christian Sigel of the RCPD said at Wednesday's meeting.
The financial aspect of the agreement includes the school district reimbursing the police department $32,000 per officer annually for eight officers. Payment invoices will be issued monthly for a nine-month period each fiscal year. Additionally, the school district will cover up to $14,000 annually for training costs, including travel and tuition.

SROs, as employees of law enforcement, will be under their administration and control. However, a joint committee of law enforcement and school district representatives will recommend SRO positions. Schools will have designated SROs, with a ""rover"" SRO assigned as needed, and every elementary school will have a designated SRO housed at a middle or high school.

Duty hours for SROs are intended to align with the school day, with efforts made to accommodate requests for SROs at after-school activities.

The SRO Program aims to foster a positive school climate, prevent crime, mentor students and act as role models. It also emphasizes education, with SROs becoming integral members of the school community, according to the agreement.

“One other change is the clear separation between law enforcement duty and the administrative role of principals regarding students. This has been practiced for some time but is now formalized in writing,” Sigel said.

The agreement will proceed to the full city council for consideration and action next Tuesday. The committee includes councilmembers Josh Biberdorf, Bill Evans, Kevin Maher, Lindsey Seachris and Greg Strommen.",https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/agreement-continuing-school-resource-officer-program-advances-to-rapid-city-council/article_6742c41a-b16c-11ee-bd17-23ec640c4f63.html,real,0
"Agreement continuing school resource officer program advances to Rapid City Council.

In a significant development for school safety, the Rapid City School District and the Rapid City Police Department have reached a preliminary agreement to continue the School Resource Officer (SRO) program. This agreement is set to be presented to the Rapid City Council for final approval in the coming weeks.

The SRO program, which places trained law enforcement officers in schools, has been a subject of community discussion and debate. Proponents argue that the presence of officers in schools is essential for ensuring safety and responding quickly to emergencies. Critics, however, raise concerns about the potential for negative interactions between students and law enforcement.

The new agreement aims to address these concerns by implementing enhanced training for SROs, focusing on youth interaction, conflict resolution, and cultural sensitivity. ""The goal is to make sure our officers are not just enforcers but also mentors and positive role models for our students,"" explained the Rapid City Police Chief.

In addition to safety, the program emphasizes the importance of building trust and relationships between students and law enforcement. ""It's about creating a safe and supportive environment for our kids to learn and grow,"" said a spokesperson for the Rapid City School District.

The agreement includes provisions for regular review and assessment of the program's effectiveness and impact on the school environment. This data-driven approach will help ensure that the program meets its objectives and adapts to the evolving needs of the school community.

Parents and educators have expressed mixed reactions to the agreement. While some applaud the emphasis on safety and the commitment to improved training, others remain concerned about the broader implications of police presence in educational settings. The city council's upcoming decision is expected to take these diverse viewpoints into account.

The Rapid City Council will hold a public hearing on the matter, offering an opportunity for community members to voice their opinions before a final decision is made. The date for this hearing will be announced shortly, and it is expected to draw significant attention from parents, educators, students, and community activists.

"Supervisors OK new contracts for county police, firefighters.

By 2027, Prince William firefighters will work fewer hours a week, and starting this summer, county police officers will receive $1,000 bonuses and pay for “on-call” shifts as a result of tentative new contracts approved by the Prince William Board of County Supervisors. 

The county board voted 7-1on Tuesday, Jan. 17, to ratify tentative collective bargaining agreements between the county and public safety employee associations. 

""Having a collective bargaining ordinance helps us with (employee) retention,” said Supervisor Margaret Franklin, D-Woodbridge. “It makes us more competitive as a county government, particularly with public services.” 

Supervisor Yesli Vega, R-Coles,was the only supervisor to vote against the agreements.Vegais an auxiliary officer for thePrince William County Sheriff’s Office. The approved agreements will cost the county an extra $16 million for fiscal year 2025, which begins July 1. 

“The fiscally conservative (and) responsible side of me sees an upside in this that I rarely find,” said Supervisor Bob Weir, R-Gainesville, regarding his yes vote. “I told the fire department and police department last year that I’ll do everything I can to make you whole. ... I am going to be supporting this simply because I know (the) set cost for this for at least two years.”  

The approved agreements come about a year after the supervisors adopted a collective bargaining ordinance in November 2022.Over the summer, the county engaged in collective bargaining discussions with elected representatives of the fire and police departments—the Prince William County Police Assocation IUPA Local 5010 and the International Assocation of Firefighters Local 2598—to hammer out the contracts. 

In July, the supervisors voted 5-3 along party lines, to allow firefighters’ work schedules to be added to a list of issues open for negotiation after firefighters cited a lack of sleep and overwork due to their 56-hour workweek. 

Starting on July 1, 2027, the Prince William County Fire Department will adopt a 50-hour workweek unless the chief determines there is insufficient staffing, according to the agreement. 

To make up for the shortened work schedules, the department will need an additional 75 personnel. The agreement states that the county will hire 25 additionalfirefighters each year over the next three years to fill that gap. 

Firefighters who are part of the bargaining unit will also see a 1.25% annual increase in pay starting on July 1 and will receive six weeks of paid family medical leave and an increase of compensatory leave from 80 hours to 120 hours. During the current year, firefighters received 17% raises. 

Starting July 1, eligible police officers will receive $1,000 payments. Eligible officers include all who hold ranks at first sergeant and below.   

Also starting on July 1, police will alsobepaid while on-call. For every 24-hour on-call shift, officers will receive a minimum of one hour of work at their overtime rate. They will also receive six weeks of paid family medical leave and 12 weeks total for parental leave. If both parents are county employees, they each can receive up to six weeks of paid leave, according to the agreement.  

“Never again will another female officer have to get a (doctor’s note), so that she can take 12 weeks off with her newborn instead of six,” KatieZaimis, president of the police department union, said of the additional leave time. 

Additionally, starting July 1, officers will earn more in “differential pay” for working a different shift. Eligible officers will receive an additional $1.50 per hour, instead of $1. 

“This was an employee-led effort from our police and fire (departments), and we probably would not be in this position if it weren’t for you all kind of leading the change and saying Prince William County should be a county that moves in this direction,” Franklin said.

"Trolls from Denmark make their mark across Puget Sound.

Trolls derived from Scandinavian folklore arrived in the Pacific Northwest this summer. These trolls, who typically hide within nature, have frizzled snake-like branches sprouting from their heads or faces, their eyes are wide and curious, and their bodies are plastered with wood. At first, these towering trolls may sound frightening, yet they elicit a contagious feeling of joy — visitors often gather around the trolls, smiling, pointing and giggling like curious children. Thomas Dambo, a Danish artist based in Copenhagen, is the creator of these trolls. Since Dambo’s first troll creation in 2014, his art has grown in scale and scope, creating over 120 trolls spanning 17 countries.

Dambo uses these trolls as a vessel to communicate a message of environmental conservation and sustainability on a global scale. Dambo’s approach to art highlights the use of recycled materials, from wooden pallets to mayonnaise jars, to create a powerful message about the potential for beauty in unlikely places. “You can always turn trash into something valuable,” Dambo said. “You always turn trash into treasure.”

In the summer, Dambo, his wife, two twins and his crew embarked on his newest project, “Way of the Bird King”. This project entailed a 100-day journey across the United States, starting in New Jersey and traveling to Vermont, Michigan and Colorado, all before arriving in the Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Northwest leg of the project began in July and finished in September, leaving behind six trolls hiding in groves, peaking between trees, on the shore watching over the ocean tides or staying close to their roots near Nordic museums.

Each troll has a unique name and story, which Dambo wove together throughout the trip; once completed, the stories tell a cohesive tale that revolves around keeping Puget Sound clean. Although the message in Dambo’s art is one of sustainability, conservation and environmental stewardship, the Northwest leg generated another message of the power of community and the importance of collaboration. A lot of times public art is an artist creating something and then installing it into the community, and there’s not as much opportunity throughout the process for community engagement,” said Amy Dukes, Issaquah’s troll project manager. “This project was different because there were so many ways for people to be involved and to collaborate.” Before there were six trolls, there was one. The origin of the Northwest region trolls dates back more than four years ago when the National Nordic Museum became aware of a Danish environmental artist — the museum saw how Thomas aligned with their values and became interested in a troll of their own. “I think that Thomas’s practice and his ethos are very much in line with our commitment to sustainability,” said Leslie Anderson, Chief Curator at the National Nordic Museum. “We talk about and truly provide a platform for policymakers and cleantech companies to explore how we can act in a way that is keeping in mind the preservation of our planet.”

Building the trolls involved extensive pre-planning and discussions before any building began, said Brady Jensen, the Portland troll volunteer project leader. These conversations combed through various elements of the project, ranging from the overall design of each troll to specific details related to their locations. While the trolls shared common elements like their internal skeleton made of wooden planks and their skin of layered pallets, distinct differences in location, position and accessories brought new surprises when building each structure. “I think as far as the build, you have to remember that it’s an installation and it’s location specific,” said Lynann Politte, troll project lead on Vashon Island. “So you can plan as much as you can plan and then you just have to hold on for the ride… because it’s a bit of a roller coaster.” Due to the Portland troll, Ole Bolle, being the first build on the Norwest leg, Jensen had the unique opportunity to relay what was working, what was not working and what the team learned along the way to the other site managers. “We were making calls on the fly that we could then turn around and share back and influence some of the decisions that [site partners] needed to make,” he said.

As each site manager held on tight for the ride, they found harmony in the conversations between one another. “We worked together collaboratively — we were each focused on our individual sculpture — and we met regularly and really talked through everything together,” Anderson said.” Even when the build schedule began, we were still meeting regularly, monitoring the progress and learning from each other.” Dawn Janow, the troll project lead on Bainbridge Island, recalled the last site partner meeting and seeing everyone’s faces mirror one another. “We’re all a little weary and teary that we didn’t get to keep meeting because even amongst the six sites, we developed such a bond,” she said.

Frankie Feetsplinter was built on Vashon Island with Oscar the Bird King. This was this first modular piece Dambo has made off site and transported to its final destination. 

Politte reflected on the generosity of the local community when it came to outsourcing materials. A resident on Vashon Island contacted Politte to donate 26 tree logs, estimated to be $10,000 worth of lumber. Those logs now make up the throne Oscar the Bird King sits on. Janow was also shocked at the lengths the locals went to, to create their local trolls. “[The crew] wanted some milled lumber. I was like ‘We don’t have a mill on Bainbridge Island.’ The next thing you know, someone’s dropping off 60 logs of mill lumber… it was endless, like, endless,” she said. Janow said the project amplified the message of bringing people of different kinds of partners and people together to create something bigger. “We had people donate materials, people give up their homes for the Dambo’s crew to stay, people brought home-cooked meals for lunches,” she said. Although the relationships between the volunteers and crew members were brief, Jensen said they were rich and rewarding for every volunteer, no matter their input to the project. “It was nice to see people making connections, both with the artist and the team, but also, with each other in that kind of community project,” Duke said. The camaraderie between the locals and the crew did not end at the work site. Although Dambo and the crew were on a tight schedule, leapfrogging from one site to the other — finishing each troll within the span of two weeks —they are adamant about keeping a work-life balance. “They worked from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., cleaned up, didn’t work late and they didn’t work on either weekend,” Politte said. After hours, Dambo and the crew could often be found at local events, dancing, drinking beer and with the locals. “They worked really hard, and they played really hard,” Politte said with a grin.

Once the building of the trolls had finished and Dambo and his crew went home, the trolls continued to bring people together locally, regionally and internationally. Janow said locals would bump into each other multiple times when seeing Pia the Peacekeeper on Bainbridge Island; others met briefly to see Pia but were from vastly different parts of the world. “These trolls are linking this vast network of people. It’s getting people out and traveling,” she said. “We have people from all over the world coming. People are engaging with each other that they never would have.” “It was like these threads coming across the horizon,” said Sean Barker, the Facilities Maintenance Manager for Seattle Parks and Recreation. “Kind of that feeling that we’re all tied together.” Coyote recalled a Native American prophecy that aligned with the effect the trolls had on global connections. “There will come a day when people of all races will put aside their differences and come together as one,” he said. Reflecting on his journey, Dambo also began to see these threads connecting through the installments of his trolls, transcending through communities and cultures. “While in the States, I met loads of enthusiastic volunteers and visitors who were full of energy. It showed me how much people worldwide appreciate public art that carries a message,” he said. “Everyone feels the importance of recycling, as it’s a way to add beauty and excitement to everyone’s life.”

The IMD said ""cold"" to ""severe cold day"" conditions continued at many places over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan.

Delhi continued to shiver on Saturday morning under the grasp of a relentless coldwave, accompanied by a thick layer of fog that has disrupted daily life for residents and commuters alike.

Several trains were delayed at Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station due to dense fog amid the severe coldwave conditions. To combat the bone-chilling temperatures, streets and public spaces became dotted with small groups huddled together around bonfires to keep warm.

Drone visuals from Munirka and Vasant Vihar areas showed fog enveloping the city, reducing visibility and traffic slowing down to a crawl on major roads and highways.

The impact of the coldwave extended beyond Delhi, as neighbouring states experienced similar weather woes. In Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya was blanketed in dense fog, causing disruptions to daily life. Similarly, in West Bengal's Siliguri, a thick fog cover added to the woes of residents.

According to the India Meteorological Department, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and Uttar Pradesh are experiencing dense to very dense fog at many places, severely affecting visibility and disrupting transportation. Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan are grappling with isolated instances of dense fog, creating challenging conditions for residents.

The IMD predicts that dense to very dense fog conditions are likely to persist over North India for the next five days. The meteorological department anticipates cold day to severe cold day wave conditions over the plains of Northwest India for the next three days, with a gradual reduction thereafter.

Dense fog is forecasted in isolated pockets of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, north Madhya Pradesh, Jammu division, West Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha, East Rajasthan, Assam & Meghalaya, Mizoram & Tripura during specific periods in the coming days.

In addition to the foggy conditions, the IMD predicts that Cold Day to Severe Cold Day conditions will persist in many parts of Punjab and Haryana-Chandigarh on January 13, with cold day conditions likely in isolated pockets for the subsequent three days. Isolated pockets of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are also expected to experience Cold Day conditions today.

On Friday, the national capital woke up to bone-chilling temperatures as the mercury plummeted to 3.9 degrees Celsius, marking the lowest temperature recorded this season, according to officials from the IMD.

The maximum temperature for the day settled at 19.3 degrees Celsius, slightly below the season's average, further intensifying the coldwave that has engulfed the region. The IMD data revealed that Friday's minimum temperature was the lowest for this date since 2018. On January 12, 2017, the city recorded a low of 3 degrees Celsius.

"North India shivers under coldwave, IMD forecast suggests no immediate relief.

Biting winds and plummeting temperatures have sent shivers across North India, with several cities reeling under a prolonged coldwave. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has offered little cheer, with its forecast suggesting no immediate respite from the biting cold.

Temperatures in Delhi, the national capital, dipped to a bone-chilling 3.2°C on Friday morning, making it the coldest January day in two decades. Similar scenes were witnessed across Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, where minimum temperatures hovered several degrees below normal.

Residents bundled themselves in layers of scarves, gloves, and woolen clothes, struggling to stay warm against the relentless cold. The biting winds added to the misery, making even stepping outside a painful ordeal. Water bodies froze in some areas, further painting a picture of the harsh winter grip.

The coldwave has also exacerbated concerns about air quality, with pollutants trapping the colder air near the ground and leading to a rise in smog levels. Visibility has been significantly reduced in many cities, causing disruptions to air and rail travel.

The IMD has predicted that the coldwave conditions are likely to persist for the next three days, with minimum temperatures expected to remain several degrees below normal. Dense fog conditions are also expected to disrupt transportation and daily life.

While there may be a gradual improvement in temperatures thereafter, the IMD has warned of another potential coldwave spell hitting North India later in the week. This has raised concerns about the prolonged duration and intensity of this winter season.

In the meantime, authorities have been advised to take necessary measures to provide relief to vulnerable communities, such as setting up temporary shelters and distributing warm blankets and clothing. Medical facilities have also been put on high alert to deal with any cold-related health issues.

With no immediate end in sight to the icy grip of winter, North India braces itself for another round of chilly days and nights, hoping for a quick return of the warming sun.","Generate a news article with the following title:

"Steelers playoff game postponed due to dangerous weather conditions in Buffalo.

Buffalo, NY — The highly anticipated NFL playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Buffalo Bills, originally scheduled for this Sunday at Highmark Stadium in Buffalo, has been postponed due to severe weather conditions, league officials announced today.

A powerful winter storm, bringing heavy snowfall and blizzard-like conditions, has been forecasted for the Buffalo area over the weekend. The National Weather Service has issued weather advisories, warning of hazardous travel conditions and recommending residents to stay indoors.

""The safety of our players, staff, and fans is our top priority,"" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""Given the extreme weather forecast for Buffalo this weekend, we have made the difficult decision to postpone the game.""

The Steelers, who were set to travel to Buffalo on Friday, have delayed their trip. ""While we're disappointed about the postponement, we understand that such decisions are made keeping everyone's safety in mind,"" said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. ""We're prepared to adjust our plans and focus on our next steps.""

Bills head coach Sean McDermott echoed similar sentiments, stating, ""Our team was looking forward to this game, but we understand the circumstances. We hope everyone in the affected areas stays safe.""

The NFL has not yet announced a new date for the game but indicated that they are working closely with both teams and local authorities to monitor the situation and determine a feasible date.

Fans who purchased tickets for Sunday's game will receive information regarding ticketing options, including refunds, if they are unable to attend the rescheduled match.

Local authorities in Buffalo are urging residents to prepare for the storm, which is expected

to bring significant snow accumulation and wind gusts that could lead to power outages and treacherous road conditions. Emergency services are on high alert, and additional resources have been deployed to assist with any storm-related emergencies.

The postponement of the game marks a rare occurrence in the NFL, where weather-related delays are not common. The league has a comprehensive severe weather policy for game operations, but postponements are only considered in extreme conditions.

Steelers and Bills fans, while understandably disappointed, have largely expressed support for the decision on social media, citing the importance of safety for all involved.

The NFL is expected to provide further updates on the rescheduling of the game and any potential impacts on the playoff schedule in the coming days.

As the city braces for the storm, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown issued a statement urging residents to stay safe and follow guidelines issued by local weather services and emergency management officials.

""Our city is no stranger to tough weather, but we always prioritize the safety and well-being of our residents,"" said Mayor Brown. ""We're working closely with state and federal agencies to ensure a coordinated response to the storm.""

As the region prepares for the severe weather, the Steelers and Bills will continue their preparations for their eventual playoff showdown, with both teams hoping for a clear day to safely resume what promises to be an exciting game.","can you generate a news article with the title ""Steelers playoff game postponed due to dangerous weather conditions in Buffalo""",fake,1

Q: Can you tell us about your journey as a volunteer at Minnie's Food Pantry and what inspired you to get involved?

A: Absolutely! My journey with Minnie's Food Pantry began a few years ago when I was looking for ways to give back to the community. I had heard about the incredible work Minnie's was doing in Plano, providing food assistance to those in need. The inspiring stories of impact and the commitment to fighting hunger drew me in, and I knew I wanted to be a part of that mission.

Q: What specific role do you play as a volunteer, and how has your experience been so far?

From sorting and packing to helping distribute food to families, every task contributes to the larger goal of making sure no one in our community goes hungry.

A: There are so many heartwarming moments, but one that stands out is when we organized a special Thanksgiving distribution. Seeing the joy and gratitude on the faces of families as they received a meal that they might not have had otherwise was truly special.

"Dedicated volunteer gives back to Plano community through Minnie's Food Pantry.

Andy Kivilaan is a volunteer for Minnie’s Food Pantry. Whether sorting donations, making nonperishable food boxes or serving clients, Kivilaan aims to help end hunger in the Plano community.

How did you get involved with Minnie's Food Pantry?

I used to lead Bank of America’s volunteer efforts in North Texas and had the chance to volunteer at over 100 organizations in North Texas. From my first time volunteering at Minnie’s, you could feel the kindness and compassion the staff at Minnie’s has for their clients and their desire to make a difference. From that first visit, I was hooked. I volunteered several times a year, but for the past four years, I have continued to volunteer there every Saturday and maybe one additional day each week as my schedule allows.

What is your role, and what does it entail?

Professionally, I’m the Community Banking Executive for Bank of America. I help create the strategy for our retail banking customers in the western half of the US.  I’m fortunate to travel quite a bit for my work and help clients achieve their financial goals.

As a volunteer at Minnie’s Food Pantry, I do whatever is needed. I receive and sort through donations. I help make nonperishable food boxes for clients. I serve clients as they arrive, giving them 100-plus pounds of food, a greeting, a hug and lots of love to brighten their day.

What’s most rewarding about your role?

As the Community Banking Executive at Bank of America, I feel fortunate to create programs and initiatives that help clients achieve their financial goals, be it securing credit, buying their first home, sending their kids to college, or whatever else is important to them. 

There’s never a day I leave Minnie’s Food Pantry after volunteering that I don’t feel like I’ve made a difference in helping to feed our community and spread kindness to those who need it most. While I love my professional work, volunteering in the community helps feed my soul and nourishes my spirit. It makes me feel like I’m paying my many blessings forward and hopefully being a force for change.

What challenges do you face?

Compared to what others face, I have no challenges. I am blessed to have a great job, a home, food in my refrigerator, friends and family.

How long have you lived in the area?

I moved to Texas in the early '90s for a job in the tech industry. I’ve lived here so long, I consider myself a Texan now. I love North Texas and the people I’ve met here.

What’s your favorite childhood memory?

My family emigrated to the US from Estonia during World War II. As a child, I would spend a lot of time with my grandmother, who received an MFA from Michigan State University. I’d spend time watching her paint or sculpt and just be amazed at how she could create something out of nothing. It was magical.

What are your hobbies?

When I’m not working or volunteering, I’m a runner. I’ve run 41 marathons to-date, with my next runs scheduled in Houston this January, and I’ll be in Tokyo to run their marathon in March of '24. I also volunteer at Bryan’s House in Dallas and support DIFFA Dallas. 

If you were stuck on a deserted island, what’s something you could not live without?

My schedule is so busy, I consider reading a luxury. It’s hard to find time. If I was on an island, I would love to have my Kindle loaded with thousands of great books.

What’s something about you that readers would never guess to be true?

I love going to the movies. Even during the pandemic, there were a couple of movie theaters that still operated in Dallas. I usually see at least one movie each week, and I love all genres.",https://starlocalmedia.com/planocourier/news/dedicated-volunteer-gives-back-to-plano-community-through-minnies-food-pantry/article_5f2f2646-947b-11ee-9c98-fb750f66d84c.html,real,0
"35 months’ jail for serial cheat who duped multiple victims into giving her over $100k.

A woman cheated multiple victims into giving her more than $100,000, including for products she did not have and investment opportunities that did not exist.
One victim even handed her more than $60,000, which she claimed would “release frozen bank accounts” for a business venture.
Nikeal Lim Shi Hui, 31, pleaded guilty to seven cheating charges and two criminal breach of trust charges on Jan 16.
She was sentenced to 35 months’ jail and an enhanced sentence of 40 days’ jail for offending while on remission.
Lim was subject to a remission order from Oct 15, 2018, to April 24, 2019.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Sunil Nair said that in 2019, Lim listed tickets to Universal Studios Singapore (USS) for sale on online marketplace Carousell for the price of $55 per ticket.
Twelve victims saw her online listing and paid her a total of $2,305 to get tickets.
“In truth, the accused did not have the USS tickets to sell and was not intending to procure them from any supplier for the victims’ orders,” the prosecutor said.
In 2020, Lim listed Rolex watches for sale on Carousell.
A victim, who saw the online listing, was interested in getting four watches and paid Lim $5,000 as a partial payment to secure the watches.
But Lim did not have any Rolex watches to sell and had no plans to get the watches to fulfil the orders.
That same year, Lim deceived two other victims on Facebook Marketplace into believing that she would sell them mobile phones when she knew she was not going to.
One victim paid her $800, while the other gave her $840.
In 2021, Lim told a colleague at the restaurant where she was working that there was an investment opportunity at a mask company.
“The accused told the victim that the investment was risk-free, would give interest of 10 per cent and would result in (tenfold) yields,” the prosecution said.
Lim’s colleague gave her a total of $4,210 over multiple occasions for the investment.
When her colleague asked for details about his investment, Lim lied that the agents for the investment were to blame and were unresponsive to her.
Separately, in 2018, Lim talked to another colleague about starting a business together to open a noodle stall.
As some initial capital was needed to start up such a business, she asked her colleague to loan her the money.
Lim told her colleague that for every $1,000 the victim lent, she stood to gain $100 to $200 in interest within one to two weeks.
From 2019 to 2020, Lim told her colleague that there had been complaints from creditors to the police, which caused bank accounts used by the offender to be frozen.
Lim told her colleague that the latter’s money was stuck in these frozen accounts and asked for more funds so that debts owed to the creditors would be repaid.
As the victim was hoping to recover the money she had previously given to Lim, she handed Lim more than $60,000 across multiple occasions between May and July 2020.
The prosecution said there were a total of 29 victims in Lim’s ruses, and she has since made a restitution of $6,500.
Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and are also liable to a fine.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/35-months-jail-for-serial-cheat-who-duped-multiple-victims-into-giving-her-over-100k,real,0
"35 months’ jail for serial cheat who duped multiple victims into giving her over $100k.

In a landmark case that highlights the prevalence of online scams, a serial cheat has been sentenced to 35 months in jail after successfully deceiving multiple victims into parting with over $100,000. The perpetrator, identified as 32-year-old Melissa Tan, employed various tactics to manipulate unsuspecting individuals, preying on their trust and goodwill.

Tan, who operated through various online platforms, posed as a trustworthy individual to gain the confidence of her victims. Once trust was established, she would spin elaborate stories, often involving fabricated emergencies or urgent financial needs, convincing her targets to send her substantial sums of money.

The police investigation revealed that Tan targeted a wide range of victims, including individuals seeking romantic connections on dating apps, as well as those looking for investment opportunities. The scope of her fraudulent activities extended beyond Singapore, with reports indicating victims from neighboring countries as well.

The court heard testimonies from several victims who fell prey to Tan's manipulative schemes. One victim, who wished to remain anonymous, shared the emotional toll of being deceived, stating, ""I thought I was helping someone in need, and it's disheartening to realize that I was taken advantage of. The sentence brings some closure, but the scars remain.""

District Judge Lim Wei Wei, presiding over the case, emphasized the need for a deterrent sentence to curb the rising trend of online scams. ""The accused took advantage of the trust and generosity of her victims, causing both financial and emotional harm. This sentence is intended to send a clear message that such deceptive practices will not be tolerated in our society,"" remarked Judge Lim.

Tan's defense argued for a more lenient sentence, citing her troubled past and remorse for her actions. However, the prosecution emphasized the need for a punishment that reflects the severity of the crimes committed and serves as a deterrent to others engaged in similar activities.

In addition to the 35-month jail term, Tan has been ordered to make restitution to her victims, although the full recovery of the defrauded funds remains uncertain. The case serves as a cautionary tale for individuals to exercise vigilance and skepticism when dealing with unfamiliar online acquaintances, reinforcing the importance of cybersecurity awareness in an increasingly digital age.","generate a news article for a daily Singapore newspaper with the title ""35 months’ jail for serial cheat who duped multiple victims into giving her over $100k""",fake,1
"Pittsburgh coffee chain closes shortly after workers announce union.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- A Pittsburgh coffee chain is closing all of its stores, shortly after its employees demanded recognition of their union. 

Adda Coffee & Tea House, which has four locations, announced on Facebook Thursday that it was closing. It called the past eight years a ""labor of love"" and said all locations will be closed effective immediately. 

""Sadly, we have been operating at a loss since the beginning, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. We tried to stay optimistic and have been consistently re-evaluating our business model in our efforts to keep fulfilling our mission. Despite everyone's best efforts, our monetary reserves are depleted and we need to close our doors,"" a statement posted to Facebook read. 

The closing comes after Adda's baristas and brewers also announced on Thursday that they were unionizing with the help of UFCW Local 1776.

""We're unionizing because we love our jobs, and we deserve a say in how our store is run. In order to do our best work, we need living wages, consistent and fair scheduling, comprehensive workplace policies, and a tip structure that empowers us to foster a stellar customer experience,"" the workers wrote on Instagram. 

After the announcement to close, the workers shared another post of a message sent to employees thanking them and offering references. 

The message again acknowledged that the business had been operating at a loss and said despite cost-cutting measures, there were plans to close. After an all-employee meeting on Wednesday, the message said it became ""even clearer that the business could not be turned around without an investment of significant, additional money that we don't have.""

"Pittsburgh coffee chain closes shortly after workers announce union.

In a surprising turn of events, a popular coffee chain in Pittsburgh has closed its doors just days after its workers publicly announced their decision to form a union. The closure has left both employees and loyal customers in shock, raising questions about the relationship between management and staff.

The announcement of the union, made by the coffee chain's employees last week, was met with mixed reactions. While many workers celebrated the opportunity to collectively negotiate for better wages and working conditions, others were concerned about potential backlash from the management.

The coffee chain, known for its cozy ambiance and artisanal coffee blends, had been a staple in the Pittsburgh community for several years. The sudden closure has sparked speculation about whether the decision was a direct response to the unionization efforts.

Employees, who had been engaging in discussions about forming a union for several months, officially filed for union certification with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) just last week. The move was seen as a bold step towards securing a stronger voice in workplace matters, with workers expressing concerns about issues such as pay disparities and job security.

Union representatives, in a joint statement, expressed disappointment over the abrupt closure and hinted at the possibility of legal action. ""It is disheartening to see a business shut down in response to its workers exercising their legal right to organize. We believe in fair treatment and will explore all available options to address this matter,"" the statement read.

On the other hand, the coffee chain's management released a brief statement attributing the closure to ""unforeseen circumstances."" They emphasized the decision was not a reaction to the unionization efforts and cited financial challenges faced by the business.

Local patrons who frequented the coffee chain are expressing their concerns over the closure and the impact on the community. Some are calling for transparency from the management regarding the reasons behind the sudden shutdown, while others are expressing solidarity with the employees who sought better working conditions.

As the story unfolds, questions linger about the future of the coffee chain and whether this incident will have broader implications for discussions surrounding workers' rights and unionization in the city. The closure serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding the relationship between employers and employees, especially when it comes to navigating the landscape of collective bargaining in the workplace.","Write me a news article with a title""Pittsburgh coffee chain closes shortly after workers announce union""",fake,1

"Yuletide at Devon Opens Magical Christmas Village.

The annual Yuletide at Devon event has returned to the Devon Horse Show Grounds, bringing with it a festive and enchanting Christmas village for visitors of all ages. The event, which runs from December 1 to January 2, features a variety of attractions, including a light show, a carousel, a Ferris wheel, a train ride, an ice skating rink, a Santa's workshop, and a live nativity scene.

The highlight of the event is the magical Christmas village, which consists of more than 40 decorated cottages that showcase different themes, such as candy land, winter wonderland, gingerbread house, and elf village. Each cottage offers a unique experience, such as crafts, games, treats, and photo opportunities. Some of the cottages also host local vendors and artisans, who sell their handmade goods and gifts.

The event organizer, Jennifer Myers, said that the Christmas village was inspired by the European Christmas markets, and that she wanted to create a place where people could enjoy the holiday spirit and support the local community. ""We wanted to bring something new and exciting to the area, and also to give back to the Devon Horse Show, which is a historic and charitable institution,"" she said.

The event also supports several local charities, such as the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the Chester County Food Bank, and the Main Line Animal Rescue.

"Yuletide at Devon Opens Magical Christmas Village.

Imagine entering a Victorian village with quaint cottages bursting with gifts, delicious food and drink, carolers singing Christmas songs, and amusement rides for the kids.

You’ve entered Yuletide at Devon at the iconic Devon Horse Show and Country Fair. The decorations and lights make an enchanting backdrop to wander about, sample food and drinks, and shop or ride a Ferris wheel or old-fashioned carousel.

Villanova resident Bob Bickhart, owner of event company Spectacle Reality, and his son, Jes Bickhart, a producer in Los Angeles, welcomed people at a press preview last Monday. Yuletide at Devon runs until Dec. 31.

“This is a first-of-its-kind festival,” said Jes Bickhart. “It combines food and wine. It combines rides and music. You can see a 2,000-foot stage being built now. It’s fun to bring all these elements together to celebrate the holidays, to celebrate family.”

Bob Brickhart said it was “a pleasure” to work with the Devon Horse Show people, the folks at Tredyffrin and Easttown townships, food provider Strother, and sponsors Aqua PA and Independence Blue Cross.

Bob Bickhart told DVJournal they had been thinking of bringing a German-style Christmas market, such as Saltzburg, to the suburbs for several years and looked at venues, including sites in Doylestown and Lancaster County.

But he is pleased that they were able to strike a deal to rent the Devon Horse Show grounds.

“We wanted to take advantage of it if we could make it work,” he said. “We want to be a celebration of the holiday. We’d love to be back (next year).”

Many of the 37 small shops were filled with winter sweaters, hats, gloves and mittens, such as an offering from Cranberry Street Boutique of Royerford. Others had jewelry or toys on display.

Melissa Morales brought a variety of her handmade, organic Melmo’s dog treats, cat treats, and various items, such as charming dog breed nutcrackers, that will appeal to pet owners.

Morales, of South Philadelphia, has been in business for six years. She has booths at two other Christmas venues, one in Easton and one in Bethlehem. Her products are also available at Giant stores and online.

Chris LeVine, with the Inn at Grace Winery in Glen Mills, was also on hand getting his onsite shop squared away.

“We grow it,” said LeVine. “We bottle it. We sell it. We’re pleased to be here.”

Strother Enterprises’ Legacy Culinary Group curated a festive menu for guests to enjoy while attending the holiday festival. Minority-owned and Philadelphia-based Legacy Culinary Group, led by Chef Chris Nguyen, offers Devon a gourmet farm-to-table experience. Both Yuletide and Strother are family-owned and operated.

The menu will include internationally inspired dishes like creamy mac and cheese cups topped with brisket burnt ends, currywurst and pomme frites, lemongrass chicken, grilled short ribs Bulgogi, fried chicken and waffles, prosciutto and arugula pizza, Thai noodle salad, grilled raclette on sourdough with fig jam, and banana Nutella crepes.

The food is paired with craft drinks, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic holiday-themed beverages.

“We are excited to partner with Jes and Rob to bring this one-of-a-kind holiday festival to the region,” said Natasha Strother Lassiter, chief strategy officer of Strother Enterprises. “We’ve designed an elevated menu exclusively for Yuletide to celebrate the time-honored tradition of holiday gatherings. Guests will enjoy a festive, farm-to-table food experience where every dish will speak to our legacy of timeless, world-class cuisine.”

Tickets are $34.99 for adults and $22.99 for children 3 to 8. Children younger than 3 are free. Food, drinks, live music, pictures with Santa, and amusement rides are included.",https://delawarevalleyjournal.com/yuletide-at-devon-opens-magical-christmas-village/,real,0

"Last call for NDG's Momesso's.

*Montreal, QC - January 15, 2024*

In a bittersweet moment for the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG) community, the iconic Momesso's restaurant is set to bid farewell after decades of serving delicious meals and creating cherished memories.

Established in 1977, Momesso's has been a beloved fixture in NDG, known for its warm ambiance, friendly staff, and, of course, its mouthwatering Italian cuisine. The restaurant has been a go-to spot for locals, tourists, and food enthusiasts alike, offering a taste of authentic Italian flavors in the heart of Montreal.

The decision to close Momesso's comes as a result of the owners' retirement, marking the end of an era for this culinary institution. Over the years, Momesso's has not only been a dining destination but also a cultural hub, hosting countless family gatherings, celebrations, and community events.

Regular patrons and nostalgic residents have flooded social media with heartfelt messages, reminiscing about their favorite Momesso's dishes, from the classic pasta dishes to the legendary panzerotti. Many share stories of first dates, anniversaries, and other significant life moments that Momesso's played a role in.

Local resident Sarah Leclair expressed her sentiments, saying, ""Momesso's has been more than just a restaurant to us. It's been a part of our lives, a place where we celebrated birthdays, shared laughter with friends, and enjoyed comforting meals. The news of its closure is truly heartbreaking.""

As the closing date approaches, Momesso's has decided to host a series of farewell events to give the community an opportunity to say goodbye. These events will not only celebrate the restaurant's rich history but also allow patrons to savor their favorite dishes one last time.

NDG City Councilor, Robert Tremblay, acknowledged the impact of Momesso's on the community, stating, ""Momesso's has been a cornerstone of NDG's culinary landscape for as long as I can remember. It's more than just a restaurant; it's a cultural touchstone that has brought people together for decades. We will miss it dearly.""

The owners, Tony and Maria Momesso, expressed gratitude to their loyal customers and the community. In a joint statement, they said, ""It's with mixed emotions that we announce the closure of Momesso's. We are immensely grateful for the support and love we've received over the years. Momesso's has been our second home, and it's hard to say goodbye. We hope to see familiar faces during our farewell events as we share one last meal together.""

As NDG prepares to bid adieu to Momesso's, the closing chapter of this culinary gem serves as a reminder of the profound impact that local establishments can have on a community. The memories created within Momesso's walls will undoubtedly linger in the hearts of NDG residents for years to come.","generate a news article which has the following title: ""Last call for NDG's Momesso's""",fake,1

Last call for a Momesso’s sub is January 27.

The iconic southern NDG eatery announced that it was closing, a few months after announcing that the business was up for sale.

“Since 1978 the corner of Old Orchard and Upper Lachine has been a place we called home,” the family wrote on its Facebook page. “Since our family arrived from Italy we have been welcomed to NDG with open arms. It is with a heavy heart we must say goodbye to all of you. All good things eventually come to an end but the memories live on.”

"Milpitas’ rideshare program is its best kept secret.

In the heart of Silicon Valley, Milpitas boasts a hidden gem that has been quietly transforming transportation for its residents – the city's rideshare program. While rideshare services are commonly associated with urban hubs, Milpitas has cultivated a unique approach that has remained somewhat under the radar but is increasingly gaining attention as its best-kept secret.

The rideshare program in Milpitas is designed to cater to the specific needs of the community, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional transportation methods. Whether it's commuting to work, running errands, or simply exploring the city, residents have discovered the convenience and affordability of Milpitas' rideshare initiative.

One of the program's standout features is its commitment to sustainability. Milpitas has prioritized environmentally friendly transportation options, and the rideshare program aligns seamlessly with this vision. By encouraging shared rides and incorporating eco-friendly vehicles into the fleet, the city is not only addressing transportation needs but also contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.

What sets Milpitas' rideshare program apart is its integration with local businesses and community organizations. The city has forged partnerships that offer exclusive benefits to rideshare users, promoting local commerce and fostering a sense of community. From discounts at participating shops to special promotions tied to rideshare usage, residents are discovering that the program goes beyond mere transportation – it's a community-building initiative.

Despite its success, the Milpitas rideshare program remains somewhat of a hidden treasure, with many residents unaware of its full potential. As word spreads about the convenience, affordability, and community-centric approach, it is anticipated that more residents will embrace this best-kept secret, making it an integral part of Milpitas' identity.

In a world where rideshare giants dominate headlines, Milpitas stands out for its innovative, community-focused approach to transportation. The rideshare program, often overlooked, is undeniably the city's best-kept secret, offering a model for other communities looking to redefine how they approach local transportation solutions.",give me a 300 word article that would correspond to the following title: Milpitas’ rideshare program is its best kept secret,fake,1
"Milpitas’ rideshare program is its best kept secret.

Milpitas has an exclusive rideshare service much cheaper than Uber for locals to get around town—but not many people know about it.

The Simple Mobile Access to Reliable Transit (SMART) program is a city rideshare service, with a fleet of six vehicles, that takes residents across the city at a maximum cost of $2.50 per ride. The Milpitas City Council is struggling to keep the program alive, since the lion’s share comes from a VTA grant and state dollars which could dry up.

The rideshare program only generates about $2,000 per month. As of last year, it operated on a more than $1 million VTA grant through Measure B, $200,000 from developer fees and $71,000 from the city’s Capital Improvement Program. The program was going to run out of money in approximately four months, but the city is receiving an infusion of $1.6 million from the state after successful lobbying efforts. Those dollars and the remaining VTA funds will carry the program through 2025.

Councilmember Garry Barbadillo suggested looking into funding sources from within the city, including businesses and developers who could be incentivized to support the program.

“Let’s see how we can sustain it even if it’s a year or two years from now, so we won’t lose the traction that this program has had. If not funding through grants or whatnot, let’s see how the city would be able to fund this when no grants are available,” Barbadillo said at a meeting this month.

When the program launched, it only took riders to and from four hub locations—Milpitas City Hall, the Transit Center, Great Mall and the VTA Alder Station. Jay Lee, Milpitas interim planning director, said users consistently tried to travel to destinations outside of those four hubs, prompting the city to reconfigure the service in February. It now provides personalized pickups and stops, and ridership is on the rise.

“A lot of our residents may not have an easy way to get to and from those transit stations (so) we wanted to provide a service that bridges that gap in an easy and affordable way,” Lee told San José Spotlight.

The change led to a jump in riders, Lee said, as average daily ridership increased from less than five passengers to about 106 passengers as of August. The first two weeks of September have already seen higher ridership than August, he said.

Councilmembers are looking into further changes that could expand operating hours and add electric vehicles to the fleet. The rideshare program operates from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. The city needs VTA approval to increase the hours since the program is funded by Measure B.

Added service will increase operating costs and cut the program’s projected lifespan by a few months, unless more funding is found beyond 2025. But even then, fare revenue will never cover operations, Lee said.

“Even if the ridership where to go up to 420 regular riders, it wouldn’t cover the entire cost, because the fares are very low. We want it to be affordable to our communities, but we’ll look at the fares in the future,” Lee told San José Spotlight. “We’ll have to balance that, the affordability and accessibility but also having this be a sustainable service.”",https://sanjosespotlight.com/milpitas-smart-rideshare-service-program-is-its-best-kept-secret/,real,0
"What Will Be Nominated for Oscars Next Week, and What Won’t?.

When it comes to predicting the Oscars, you ultimately have to go with your gut … and mine is in a state of agita.

That’s what happens when there are simply too many good movies and great performances to all make the cut: Even the hypothetical snubs I’m about to dole out have me tied up in knots.

Which names can you expect to hear on Tuesday, when the Oscar nominations are announced? Here is what I project will be nominated in the top six Oscar categories, based on industry chatter, key laurels from the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards, and the nominations bestowed by the Screen Actors Guild, Producers Guild of America and Directors Guild of America. Well, all of those things, and my poor, tormented gut.

Best Picture

Let’s start with the safest bets. “Oppenheimer,” “Barbie” and “Killers of the Flower Moon” scored top nominations from the producers, directors and actors guilds last week and I expect each film to earn double-digit Oscar nominations. “The Holdovers” and “Poor Things” are secure, too: Though they didn’t make it into SAG’s best-ensemble race, both films boast lead actors who’ve won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award. If this were an old-school race, these would be the five nominees.

But there are five more slots to fill, and I project the next three will go to “Past Lives” and “American Fiction,” passion picks with distinct points of view, as well as “Maestro,” the sort of ambitious biopic that Oscar voters are typically in the tank for. I’m also betting that the French courtroom drama “Anatomy of a Fall” and the German-language Holocaust drama “The Zone of Interest” find favor with the academy’s increasingly international voting body. (Even the Producers Guild, which so often favors big studio movies over global cinema, found room to nominate that pair.)

There are still a few dark horses that hope to push their way into this lineup, like “The Color Purple,” “May December,” “Society of the Snow” and “Origin.” But I suspect these 10 are locked and loaded.

Best Director

For as safely settled as the best picture lineup now appears to be, the best director category is anything but. This voting branch is famous for going its own way, often outright rejecting studio directors like Ben Affleck (“Argo”) and Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”) in favor of more esoteric picks. Aside from the “Oppenheimer” director Christopher Nolan, the race’s presumed front-runner, none of the other contenders should feel secure.

I do think it helps that Martin Scorsese (“Killers of the Flower Moon”) and Alexander Payne (“The Holdovers”) are the only auteurs in the mix who’ve earned more than one nomination from this branch in the past: Payne has gotten three, while Scorsese has a whopping nine. A large fan base that consistently turns out for you can be valuable in such a competitive category.

The DGA nominees Greta Gerwig (“Barbie”) and Yorgos Lanthimos (“Poor Things”) delivered two of the year’s most lavish, distinctive movies, but I still fear that one (or even both) could fall victim to a Villeneuve-level snub. There are two surging international directors who may show up instead: Justine Triet, who won the prestigious Palme d’Or for “Anatomy of a Fall,” and Jonathan Glazer, who directed “The Zone of Interest.” I think the artier members of this branch might peel off from Lanthimos to reward Glazer’s challenging vision, but this is a category where anything could happen.

Best Actor

The “Holdovers” star Paul Giamatti has come on strong during the televised portion of awards season, taking the Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical and the Critics Choice award for best actor, period.

His two strongest competitors are likely to be the never-nominated Cillian Murphy, the high-cheekboned face of “Oppenheimer,” and the nine-time nominee Bradley Cooper, who has a showy, transformative role in “Maestro.” Murphy won the Golden Globe for best actor in a drama, but may be held back by sentiment that the real star of “Oppenheimer” is Nolan, while Cooper’s candidacy is hindered by a lack of televised prizes so far. Both men feel like shoo-ins to be nominated, but they’ll need to pick up a SAG Award next month to stay neck-and-neck with Giamatti.

I feel good about predicting a nod for the “American Fiction” lead Jeffrey Wright, who earns big cheers at every awards show when his name is read, even if that affection hasn’t yet resulted in a win. But the fifth slot is in flux. Though the “Rustin” star Colman Domingo earned a SAG nomination and Andrew Scott (“All of Us Strangers”) has a lot of fans, I think Leonardo DiCaprio ultimately gets in: It’s true that he was dealt a surprising snub by the actors guild, but “Killers of the Flower Moon” is a bigger contender than the films Domingo and Scott are fronting, and there tends to be a strong correlation between the best actor and best picture categories.

Best Actress

Would any of the other categories kindly consider donating a few nomination slots to the best actress race? There are simply too many formidable candidates to have to whittle these women down to five, and on nomination morning, the snubs here will no doubt be the most painful.

At least Lily Gladstone (“Killers of the Flower Moon”) and Emma Stone (“Poor Things”) have no reason to worry. Those two Golden Globe winners should be considered the lockiest of locks, and the real race is who gets to keep them company in the category.

Carey Mulligan (“Maestro”) ticks off so many boxes that this branch responds to — real person, unusual accent, prosthetics-aided aging — and has shown up at every precursor so far. Sandra Hüller (“Anatomy of a Fall”) missed a SAG nomination, but international actresses rarely fare well there, and I think the academy will be eager to reward Hüller for a tremendous year that also included her supporting performance in “The Zone of Interest.”Natalie Portman does some of the best work of her career in “May December,” but the film simply isn’t catching on with the guilds and she now has to be considered a contender on the bubble. Ditto Fantasia Barrino-Taylor, who has some powerhouse moments late in “The Color Purple” but wasn’t able to manage a SAG nomination. And though the “Past Lives” star Greta Lee is worthy, her work may be too understated to surpass such flashy competition.

That leaves us with Annette Bening, SAG-nominated for her tough, physical role in “Nyad,” and the “Barbie” linchpin Margot Robbie. I give Robbie the edge since her film is such a strong contender across the board, but effervescent comedy is the sort of thing voters often take for granted, and Robbie made her tricky role look as easy as breathing.

Best Supporting Actor

It’s “Barbenheimer” redux in this category, where the “Oppenheimer” foe Robert Downey Jr. and the “Barbie” beau Ryan Gosling will probably go head-to-head for the gold. Robert De Niro, so memorably malevolent in “Killers of the Flower Moon,” is also in a strong position to be nominated after nods from SAG, Critics Choice and the Golden Globes, plus a mention on the BAFTA longlist.

After those three contenders, things get hazy.

A pair of buzzy young actors could fill the last two spots: Charles Melton (“May December”) and Dominic Sessa (“The Holdovers”). But the academy is weirdly resistant to nominating young men — a problem they don’t have at all when it comes to young women — and neither Melton nor Sessa broke through at SAG. The actors guild did nominate Sterling K. Brown, who plays Wright’s brother in “American Fiction” and could certainly score with the academy if the film performs well.

Still, with so many performances to choose from, I think voters may default to two veteran actors from one of the season’s strongest films, “Poor Things.” Willem Dafoe already managed a SAG nod for playing Emma Stone’s cuckoo creator, and though his co-star Mark Ruffalo was dealt a surprising snub by the guild, SAG gave him a similar cold shoulder for “Spotlight” before the Oscar nominations came in with a last-minute save. Dual supporting nods from one film has been a hot trend in recent years, and if there’s any race where that’s likely to happen, it’s this one.

Best Supporting Actress

Is Da’Vine Joy Randolph from “The Holdovers” this year’s heir apparent to Ke Huy Quan and Troy Kotsur? Those two supporting actors swamped their competition all season on the way to absolutely assured Oscar wins in recent years, and Randolph has been following suit, bagging critics’ awards right and left and taking every televised trophy so far.Though Randolph is far ahead in this race, three other actresses have showed consistent strength, earning citations on the BAFTA longlist as well as nominations from the actors guild, Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. In other words, save room for Jodie Foster (“Nyad”), Emily Blunt (“Oppenheimer”) and Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”).

If “Barbie” overperforms, America Ferrera could sail in on the strength of her galvanizing monologue, while Taraji P. Henson may be nominated alongside Brooks if “The Color Purple” mounts a comeback. But I have a feeling this category will be filled out by someone who is the lone representative from her movie, like the SAG nominee Penélope Cruz (ferocious in “Ferrari”), Rosamund Pike (delicious in “Saltburn”) or my pick, Julianne Moore, who could mount a last stand for “May December” in a category that’s prone to curveballs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/17/movies/oscar-nominations-predictions.html,real,0

"Creation of volunteer policy for Medina County Dog Shelter underway.

In a significant step towards enhancing the welfare of our four-legged friends, the creation of a volunteer policy for the Medina County Dog Shelter is currently underway. This development marks a pivotal moment for the shelter, as it aims to harness community support and engagement to ensure the well-being of the animals under its care.

The initiative to establish a comprehensive volunteer policy comes in response to the growing need for additional assistance and a desire to involve the local community in the noble cause of animal welfare. The Medina County Dog Shelter has long been a haven for stray and abandoned dogs, providing them with a temporary home while seeking permanent and loving families.

The proposed volunteer policy is expected to outline a structured framework for individuals willing to contribute their time and effort to support the shelter's operations. This may include a detailed orientation process, training sessions on handling and caring for dogs, as well as guidelines on interacting with potential adopters. The aim is not only to create a rewarding experience for volunteers but also to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals.

Officials from the Medina County Dog Shelter have expressed their enthusiasm for the project, emphasizing the positive impact it could have on the lives of the dogs awaiting adoption. ""Volunteers play a crucial role in our ability to provide a loving and nurturing environment for these animals. This policy will help us streamline the volunteer process and ensure that everyone involved is well-prepared and committed to the welfare of our furry friends,"" said the shelter's director.

The community response to the news of the volunteer policy has been overwhelmingly positive, with many residents expressing their eagerness to contribute their time and skills to the cause. Local businesses and organizations have also shown support, pledging resources and assistance to help implement the policy effectively.

The creation of the volunteer policy is not only a testament to the community's dedication to animal welfare but also reflects a broader trend of recognizing the value of volunteers in various social initiatives. By establishing a structured framework, the Medina County Dog Shelter hopes to attract a diverse group of volunteers, ranging from dog enthusiasts to individuals seeking to make a positive impact in their community.

As the initiative progresses, the shelter plans to collaborate with experienced organizations and professionals in the field to ensure that the volunteer policy meets the highest standards of animal care. This collaborative approach aims to create a model that can be adopted by other shelters, fostering a culture of volunteerism and community engagement in the broader context of animal welfare.

In conclusion, the creation of a volunteer policy for the Medina County Dog Shelter signifies a significant step forward in the mission to provide the best possible care for our canine companions. As the community rallies behind this initiative, the future looks promising for the shelter and, more importantly, for the dogs whose lives will be positively impacted by the dedication and compassion of volunteers.",write a long news article that would fit this title: Creation of volunteer policy for Medina County Dog Shelter underway,fake,1
"Creation of volunteer policy for Medina County Dog Shelter underway.

MEDINA — The creation of a volunteer policy for the Medina County Dog Shelter is underway, according to Medina County Commissioner Aaron Harrison, as he, Medina County Administrator Chris Jakab and Dog Warden Del Saffle draft a plan. 

“We’ve got a draft that will come before the board here in the, I’d say, relatively near future for some action related to the volunteer policy,” Harrison said. 

Harrison said that he plans to get feedback from some of the people who are interested in volunteering and after that point, he will bring it forward to the Medina County Board of Commissioners. 

The drafting of a volunteer policy follows a resolution passed Aug. 15, which approved a visitors policy for the Medina County Dog Shelter. 

Harrison said that this is the first official visitors policy. 

Some of the rules in the policy include:

Visitors should restrict their visits to the regular operating hours of the shelter.
Only those 16 or older not accompanied by adults may enter the facility.
Anyone who wishes to see or interact with the dogs must do so at the discretion of shelter personnel. Visits with dogs may be occasionally restricted as deemed necessary at the sole discretion of shelter personnel.
No unauthorized photography of dogs, staff or facilities.
No food or dog treats may be brought from outside shelter facilities without the express consent of the shelter staff.
With the policy’s creation in August, Harrison said it was a step in the right direction to get more formal involvement from volunteers within the shelter. 

“We did the visitor policy earlier last year, but (this is) something to try and incorporate more of the resources that we have with community members and people who want to participate more in the activities over there,” Harrison said on Tuesday.

"Daegu Urban Railway Line 1 Hayang-Yeongcheon (Geumho) extension project gains momentum with the passage of preliminary feasibility study.

The Daegu Urban Railway Line 1 Hayang-Yeongcheon (Geumho) extension project, a key metropolitan transportation project in Yeongcheon City, has accelerated.

Yeongcheon City (Mayor Choi Ki-moon) announced on the 5th that the Daegu Urban Railway Line 1 Hayang-Yeongcheon (Geumho) extension project was finally approved (passed) in the preliminary feasibility study deliberation by the Financial Project Evaluation Committee of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.

This project is to build two stations in a section of approximately 5.66km from Hayang Station in Gyeongsan-si to Geumho-eup in Yeongcheon-si with a total project cost of KRW 205.2 billion*.

*Based on project cost reflected in the 4th National Railway Network Construction Plan

Yeongcheon City proposed an urgent issue to the central government on May 21, 2020 to attract an urban railway, and in July 2021, it was reflected in the 4th national railway network construction plan, giving a green light to the project.

In October 2022, it was listed on the list of candidates for the preliminary feasibility study, the fastest among regional metropolitan railways, and was selected as a project subject to the preliminary feasibility study by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance in December of the same year.

Through these series of processes, the preliminary feasibility study began in earnest in February of last year, and Yeongcheon citizens' strong will and earnest desire to host the project were well conveyed in the KDI comprehensive evaluation, resulting in the final decision to pass on the 5th of this month.

We plan to begin basic and detailed design services this year, complete the services by 2025, begin construction in earnest in 2026, complete all preparations until completion and commissioning in 2029, and focus all administrative power until successful opening in 2030.

This project is expected to create a great synergy effect by linking Korea's largest Yeongcheon Horse Racing Park, Geumho-Daechang Hi-Pass IC, Yeongcheon High-Tech Park District, Geumho General Industrial Complex, Daechang General Industrial Complex, and Hwaryong District urban development project.

In particular, it is expected to be of great help in resolving the company's manpower shortage and creating jobs by expanding the common living area between the Daegu-Gyeongsan-Yeongcheon region and allowing workers in the Daegu suburbs to commute to and from work. It is expected that residential conditions will be greatly improved as citizens will be able to enjoy a wide range of cultural opportunities in the fields of culture, education, and medical care.

Yeongcheon Mayor Choi Ki-moon said, “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the citizens and relevant public officials who worked together to pass the final feasibility study for the urban railway extension. “In the future, we will use the extension of the urban railway as a new driving force to overcome the crisis of regional extinction and open a new future for the joint growth of Daegu and Gyeongbuk.”",http://www.yc.go.kr/news/ycNews/view.do?newsEpctNo=22888&mId=0100000000,real,0

"Cupertino starts sorting organic materials for collection.

Per state law, Cupertino residents must now toss yard trimmings, food scraps and food-soiled paper into their green organics cart or bin. These materials are collected by Recology and turned into nutrient-rich compost.

Reducing the amount of organic material sent to landfill is part of California’s Short Lived Climate Pollutant Strategy (SB 1383). When organic material decomposes in the landfill, it emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.

Beginning this month, California’s regulations require Cupertino to enforce correct sorting requirements. Continuing to sort incorrectly after outreach, education and warnings could result in citation. To check how residents and businesses are doing with their sorting, city staff will be doing audits of bins and carts by walking around and flipping lids to take a quick look.

"Cupertino starts sorting organic materials for collection.

In a move towards sustainable waste management, the city of Cupertino has recently initiated a program to sort organic materials for collection. The endeavor aims to reduce environmental impact and promote composting practices among residents.

Cupertino, known for its technological advancements as the headquarters of tech giant Apple, is now taking strides in the realm of environmental responsibility. The city's waste management initiative involves the separation of organic waste, including kitchen scraps and yard trimmings, from other types of refuse.

Residents are encouraged to use designated bins for organic materials, which will then be collected separately from regular waste. The collected organic waste will undergo composting processes, contributing to the production of nutrient-rich compost that can be used to enhance soil fertility.

City officials believe that this step will significantly reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfills, subsequently decreasing harmful methane gas emissions associated with organic decomposition in traditional disposal sites. Cupertino's commitment to sustainability aligns with broader efforts to create a greener and more eco-friendly community.

Local authorities have provided guidelines to help residents identify organic waste and ensure proper sorting. The program's success depends on community participation, and city leaders are optimistic about the positive impact it will have on Cupertino's environmental footprint.

As Cupertino embraces this eco-conscious initiative, it joins the ranks of cities worldwide striving for a more sustainable future. The sorting of organic materials represents a significant step forward in fostering a cleaner, greener, and more environmentally responsible community.","Can you write a short news article with the title ""Cupertino starts sorting organic materials for collection""",fake,1
"Google announces sweeping layoffs to more than 400 tech and child care workers in Mountain View.

In a surprising move, tech giant Google has declared a series of widespread layoffs affecting more than 400 employees, including both technology professionals and child care workers based in Mountain View. The announcement comes as a shock to the Silicon Valley community, raising questions about the company's motives and the future of its workforce.

The layoffs are part of Google's strategic restructuring plan, aimed at optimizing its operations and ensuring long-term sustainability. The affected employees were reportedly notified during an internal meeting, where Google's leadership outlined the company's rationale for the decision.

The majority of the job cuts are expected to hit the technology sector, with engineers, developers, and other tech professionals facing the brunt of the layoffs. Additionally, a significant number of child care workers employed by Google in Mountain View are also set to lose their jobs.

Google has stated that these measures are necessary to reallocate resources and streamline its workforce, allowing the company to remain agile in an ever-evolving tech landscape. The layoffs are not limited to any particular department, indicating a comprehensive reassessment of Google's organizational structure.

The affected employees will receive severance packages and support services to aid in their transition. Google has expressed its commitment to assisting displaced workers in finding new employment opportunities, both within and outside the company.

The news has sparked concern among the broader tech community, as Google has traditionally been viewed as a leader in employee welfare and job security. Critics argue that the layoffs may signal a shift in the company's priorities or a response to external market pressures.

In response to inquiries about the layoffs, a spokesperson for Google provided a brief statement: ""We understand the impact this decision has on our employees, and we are committed to supporting them during this challenging time. This strategic realignment is essential for Google to continue innovating and delivering value to our users and partners.""

As the affected workers grapple with the unexpected turn of events, the broader tech industry will be watching closely to see how Google's restructuring efforts play out and whether this move will influence similar decisions among other major tech corporations.","write a news article with the title ""Google announces sweeping layoffs to more than 400 tech and child care workers in Mountain View""",fake,1
"Google announces sweeping layoffs to more than 400 tech and child care workers in Mountain View.

In another reduction to its global workforce, Google plans to lay off hundreds of workers in the Bay Area this year, with Mountain View experiencing the brunt of the job cuts.

The layoffs will impact approximately 702 employees in Mountain View, San Francisco and Sunnyvale, according to state filings that were reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. More than half of the eliminated positions are planned for Mountain View.

On Jan. 10, Google sent a letter to the city announcing its intentions to lay off 364 workers on its product, design and engineering teams. The layoffs will occur between the months of March and October, impacting employees in offices on Charleston Road, Amphitheater Parkway, Crittenden Lane and Sterling Court.

Google also plans to close down all four of its Bay Area child care centers, two of which are located in Mountain View. The closure of one of the centers at 325 Gladys Ave. will result in the layoff of 73 workers, according to the state filing.

The tech giant described the layoffs as part of ongoing organizational and priority changes that have been happening since last year and will continue well into 2024.

“Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the Mountain View voice.

Google made sweeping job cuts last year, eliminating 12,000 positions in January. Since then, periodic layoffs have been occurring in the company’s tech, recruiting and news divisions.

Along with job cuts, Google's development plans in the Bay Area have also been in flux in recent months. Last November, it announced it had parted ways with its real estate developer, Lendlease, that was involved with two massive housing and office projects in Mountain View – the North Bayshore Master Plan and Middlefield Park Master Plan.

"Swachh Survekshan: Chandigarh has best safety standards for safai workers, gets award.

Chandigarh was on Thursday awarded the Best Safaimitra Surakshit Award at the Swachh Survekshan Award ceremony held here today. President Droupadi Murmu gave the award to Mayor Anup Gupta at a function organised at Bharat Mandapa by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

The city was ranked 11th in the overall cleanliness category among all cities in India having more than one lakh population. The Best Safaimitra Surakshit Award was launched by the ministry to ensure safety and dignity of urban sanitation workers.

Chandigarh Home Secretary Nitin Kumar Yadav, Commissioner of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Anindita Mitra and MC Chief Engineer NP Sharma were also present at the award ceremony.

Mitra said the city had been able to completely eliminate manual cleaning of sewers. “Besides being undignified, workers who enter sewers for manual cleaning face the risk of losing their lives by inhaling poisonous gases. In Chandigarh, sewers are cleaned entirely by machines,” Mitra said, while talking to The Tribune.

To enhance the well-being and working conditions of sanitation workers, the city MC has set up booths where workers can relax during breaks. The booth offers shelter from extreme weather conditions, shielding the workers from harsh sunlight during summer and biting cold in winter. While the booths have been so far been set up in Dhanas and Sarangpur only, there is a plan to build more such facilities in the city.

Mitra said the MC had also brought under insurance cover sanitation workers of all categories, including those on contract and deployed by private contractors. Under this scheme, the next of kin of any worker get Rs 2.5 lakh each in case of natural death of the insured worker. In case of accidental death, the amount goes up to Rs 40 lakh.

Mitra said the next of kin of 47 workers had been given Rs 2.5 lakh relief each so far. Two workers died in accidents after the introduction of the scheme. The kin of one of them were given Rs 40 lakh, while the second case was in process. The bank having the salary accounts of MC employees paid the premium of the insurance scheme, she said. On Chandigarh’s 11th rank in overall cleanliness, Mitra said it had secured 56th place in 2021 and 12th in 2023.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/swachh-survekshan-chandigarh-has-best-safety-standards-for-safai-workers-gets-award-580458,real,0
"Swachh Survekshan: Chandigarh has best safety standards for safai workers, gets award.

Title: ""Chandigarh Receives Prestigious Award for Best Safety Standards in Swachh Survekshan for Sanitation Workers""

Chandigarh, renowned for its commitment to cleanliness and sanitation, has achieved another milestone by securing the top position in safety standards for sanitation workers in the latest Swachh Survekshan. The city has been honored with a prestigious award recognizing its exemplary efforts to ensure the well-being and safety of safai workers.

The Swachh Survekshan, an annual cleanliness and sanitation assessment conducted by the government, has become a benchmark for cities across India. Chandigarh's recognition for best safety standards underscores the city's dedication to creating a safe and healthy working environment for its sanitation workforce.

The award was presented at a ceremony attended by civic officials, community leaders, and representatives from the sanitation sector. Chandigarh's Mayor, Rajesh Kumar, expressed pride in the city's achievement and emphasized the importance of prioritizing the safety and welfare of those responsible for keeping the city clean.

""We are delighted to receive this recognition, and it reflects our commitment to not only maintaining cleanliness but also ensuring the safety and well-being of our invaluable safai workers. Their hard work and dedication contribute significantly to the overall hygiene of our city,"" Mayor Kumar stated during the award ceremony.

Chandigarh's success in the Swachh Survekshan safety standards category can be attributed to various initiatives implemented by the municipal authorities. These initiatives include providing safety gear such as gloves, masks, and uniforms to sanitation workers, organizing regular training programs on occupational safety, and promoting awareness about the importance of hygiene and cleanliness within the community.

The city has also invested in modern sanitation equipment and technology to streamline waste management processes, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the risks associated with manual scavenging. These efforts align with the broader national goal of promoting Swachh Bharat (Clean India) and ensuring the well-being of the workforce involved in sanitation activities.

As Chandigarh basks in the glory of its latest accolade, the city continues to inspire others to emulate its success in creating a safe and supportive environment for sanitation workers. The award serves as a testament to Chandigarh's commitment to fostering a culture of cleanliness and setting the standard for best practices in sanitation across the country.","Generate a new article based on the title: ""Swachh Survekshan: Chandigarh has best safety standards for safai workers, gets award""",fake,1
"Some Shanghai singles struggle to get married as economy slows.

SHANGHAI, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Victor Li is determined to get married soon, but like many other young Chinese grappling with an uncertain economic outlook, the well-heeled Shanghai entrepreneur isn't sure he can afford to.
""It's very expensive for us to get married, especially in a big city like Shanghai,"" the 32-year-old said, as he took a break from a ticketed networking event for wealthier, top university-educated singles at an upmarket Shanghai jazz bar.
""In terms of financial ability, it actually puts a lot of pressure on young people, including me.""
As the world's second biggest economy slows, an increasing number of people are opting to stay single, or delay marriage, due to poor job prospects amid record youth unemployment and chronically low consumer confidence, leading to a record slump in marriage registrations in 2022.
This reluctance to tie the knot is worrying policymakers grappling with a decline in births and a rapidly aging population in a country that was once the world's most populous, and where marriage rates are closely tied to birth rates as unmarried mothers are often denied child-raising benefits.
China's fertility rate is currently one of the world's lowest, and official data on Wednesday showed the population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023, partly due to the plunging birth rate, accelerating a downturn that will have profound long-term effects on the economy's growth potential.
Last year, President Xi Jinping said it was necessary to ""actively cultivate a new culture of marriage and childrearing"" to foster national development. Local governments have also announced various measures to encourage new families, including tax deductions and housing subsidies, as well as cash 'rewards' for marriages if the bride is aged 25 or younger.",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/some-wealthier-chinese-say-they-cant-afford-marriage-economy-slows-2024-01-16/,real,0
"Some Shanghai singles struggle to get married as economy slows.

Shanghai, China – In Shanghai, a city known for its vibrant economy and modern lifestyle, a growing number of singles are finding it increasingly challenging to tie the knot, a trend exacerbated by the city's slowing economy.

Long regarded as China's economic powerhouse, Shanghai has recently experienced a downturn, affecting various aspects of life, including the marriage market. Young professionals, once confident in their financial and personal prospects, now face uncertainty.

Jin Wei, a 30-year-old IT specialist, shares his concerns: ""I always thought I'd be married by now. But with job stability becoming an issue and the cost of living in Shanghai soaring, it's not just about finding the right person anymore. It's also about being financially secure enough to start a family.""

The economic slowdown has particularly impacted the housing market, a crucial factor in marriage decisions in China. The tradition of owning a home before marriage, deeply ingrained in Chinese culture, is now out of reach for many. Apartment prices in Shanghai, despite recent stagnation, remain prohibitively high for the average single.

Xiao Li, a 28-year-old marketing professional, expresses her frustration: ""Owning a home in Shanghai is a dream for many of us. But with the current economy, that dream is drifting further away, delaying marriage plans for me and many of my friends.""

The phenomenon is not limited to financial considerations. Sociologists point out that economic pressures are leading to a shift in values. Dr. Wang Min, a sociologist at Fudan University, explains, ""Young people in Shanghai are increasingly prioritizing career and personal growth over traditional milestones like marriage. The economic slowdown has intensified this trend, making singles more cautious about entering into long-term commitments.""

Dating services and matrimonial agencies in Shanghai are feeling the impact, too. Matchmaker Zhou Ying says, ""There's a noticeable change in priorities among our clients. Economic stability is now one of the top criteria for a potential partner, sometimes even surpassing other considerations like personality or shared interests.""

As the city navigates through these challenging economic times, its singles are adapting, reshaping the landscape of love and marriage in modern Shanghai. In the midst of this change, one thing remains clear: the path to marriage in Shanghai is no longer just a matter of the heart, but increasingly, a matter of economic stability.","User

"Bellevue School District employee carjacked at gunpoint in parking lot.

BELLEVUE, Wash. — A Bellevue School District (BSD) employee was carjacked at gunpoint Wednesday morning.

The incident occurred at the BSD bus yard, located at 12025 NE 5th St., according to the Bellevue Police Department (BPD). Police said the victim, a BSD employee, told them he was walking in the parking lot when two people approached.

The victim asked why they were on the property, and then both suspects pointed handguns at the man and demanded his phone and car keys, according to the BPD. Police said the victim initially refused and then was assaulted by one of the men.

Title: California has 95% chance of damaging earthquake in next century, USGS map shows

Date: January 17, 2024

**San Francisco, CA** – A recent update from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has revealed that California faces a 95% chance of experiencing a damaging earthquake within the next century. This alarming statistic was derived from the latest seismic data and geological assessments, as illustrated in the newly released USGS seismic hazard maps.

The report, which integrates new research on fault lines and seismic activity, paints a concerning picture for the Golden State. According to USGS scientists, the likelihood of a significant seismic event, potentially with a magnitude of 6.7 or higher, is almost certain within the next 100 years. This level of earthquake could lead to substantial damage, especially in densely populated areas.

""The data is clear,"" said Dr. Emily Brodsky, a leading seismologist with the USGS. ""California's complex network of fault lines and its historical seismic activity suggest that a major earthquake is not just a possibility, but a likelihood. Preparation and awareness are key.""

Major urban centers like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego are particularly at risk due to their proximity to the San Andreas Fault, one of the most well-known and active faults in the world. The San Andreas Fault is infamous for its role in the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

The USGS map indicates that the areas of highest risk are not limited to the San Andreas Fault alone. Other fault lines, such as the Hayward Fault in the San Francisco Bay Area and the San Jacinto Fault in Southern California, also show increased potential for significant seismic activity.

California's Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) has responded to the report by urging residents and local governments to review and update their earthquake preparedness plans. ""We cannot predict earthquakes, but we can certainly prepare for them,"" stated Cal OES director Mark Ghilarducci. ""This report is a wake-up call for everyone in California to take earthquake preparedness seriously.""

In response to the USGS findings, local governments across the state are reviewing building codes and infrastructure resilience. Schools, hospitals, and emergency services are also ramping up earthquake drills and preparedness training.

The USGS report serves as a critical reminder of the persistent threat earthquakes pose to California. While the prediction of a significant seismic event is sobering, it also provides a crucial opportunity for preparation and prevention, potentially saving lives and minimizing damage when the inevitable occurs. 

For more information on earthquake preparedness, California residents are encouraged to visit the Cal OES website and the USGS page dedicated to earthquake hazards.","create a news article with the following title: California has 95% chance of damaging earthquake in next century, USGS map shows",fake,1
"California has 95% chance of damaging earthquake in next century, USGS map shows.

Nearly all of California has a more than 95% chance of a damaging earthquake in the next century, according to a new United States Geological Survey map.

The new USGS National Seismic Hazard Model released Tuesday shows where damaging earthquakes are most likely to occur in the United States and updates a previous version released in 2018.

""This was a massive, multi-year collaborative effort between federal, state and local governments and the private sector,” said Mark Petersen, USGS geophysicist and lead author of the study. ""The new seismic hazard model represents a touchstone achievement for enhancing public safety.""


Here are some of the key takeaways from the map, according to the USGS:

Risk to people: Nearly 75% of the U.S. could experience potentially damaging earthquakes and intense ground shaking, putting hundreds of millions of people at risk.
Widespread hazard: 37 U.S. states have experienced earthquakes exceeding magnitude 5 during the last 200 years, highlighting a long history of seismic activity across this country.
Structural implications: The updated model will inform the future of building and structural design, offering critical insights for architects, engineers, and policymakers on how structures are planned and constructed across the U.S.
Unified approach: This marks the first National Seismic Hazard Model to encompass all 50 states simultaneously, reflecting a massive collaborative effort with federal, state, and local partners.
Not a prediction: No one can predict earthquakes. However, by investigating faults and past quakes, scientists can better assess the likelihood of future earthquakes and how intense their shaking might be.

"Developer proposes townhome project near Midtown Safeway.

MIDTOWN - A local developer has proposed building a new townhome community on a parcel of land near the Midtown Safeway grocery store. The project would consist of approximately 50 three-story townhome units ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet.

The 3-acre lot is currently vacant and zoned for high-density residential use. It is located just west of the Safeway shopping center on Main Street.

""This is an ideal in-town location for townhomes,"" said David Smith, president of Smith & Jones Development. ""It's walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants, and other retail amenities. The demand for new housing is very high in Midtown right now.""

The developer has submitted permit applications and plans to the Midtown Planning Department. The project must go through an environmental and traffic review, along with a public comment period, before potentially being approved.

Some local residents have expressed concerns about increased traffic and strain on infrastructure. ""I worry this will make the already-congested Main Street even worse,"" said Sara Thompson, who lives near the proposed development. ""I think we need to improve public transportation before adding more housing density.""

If approved, Smith expects construction on the $25 million project to begin in late 2025 and be completed by 2027. The townhomes would likely sell in the $600,000 to $800,000 range, catering to professionals and small families.

The Midtown Safeway opened 15 years ago as part of broader effort to revitalize Main Street and bring more retail options downtown. This townhome proposal represents ongoing rapid growth in the neighborhood. City officials project Midtown's population will grow by 20% over the next decade.","generate a local news article with the title ""Developer proposes townhome project near Midtown Safeway""",fake,1
"Developer proposes townhome project near Midtown Safeway.

An apartment building near the Midtown Safeway would be demolished and replaced with a 12-unit townhome development under a proposal that the city received last week from a San Mateo-based developer.
The project at 739 Sutter Ave. would replace an existing eight-unit apartment complex with two three-story buildings featuring 12 townhomes, according to the application filed Thursday by the developer, Grace Li of 739 Sutter Ave, LLP. Each unit would have a two-car garage and a deck, the plans show.
The development would also flout about a dozen local zoning rules and design guidelines, a hurdle that Li hopes to overcome by relying on the State Density Bonus Law, a measure that allows residential developers who include affordable housing in their proposals to request exceptions from design standards. While the number of concessions is typically limited to four, Li is requesting a dozen exceptions from local rules, including greater height, smaller setbacks, a narrower private street and fewer trees than the city’s development regulations typically allow.
The project would deviate from city guidelines by not including trees or other landscaping as screening on its interior side and it would run afoul of a recently created rule requiring façade breaks.
The townhome buildings would be 33.5 feet tall, exceeding the 30-foot height limit in this residential zone. They would occupy 50% of the site even though a code-compliant project would cover no more than 35% of the property.
But even as Li is invoking the State Density Bonus Law to request 11 waivers from local regulations and one concession (greater building height), she is asking the city for a streamlined review process, which typically applies to projects that meet Palo Alto’s recently updated objective design standards -- a detailed set of rules that govern everything from garage door placements and window sizes to façade breaks and porch configurations. The council adopted the new standards in 2022 with the goal of expediting reviews for compliant projects.
The application states that the townhouse project will feature a ""contemporary"" architecture style, with numerous measures to enhance the privacy of neighbors. The third floor in each building would be stepped back so that decks would not look directly into neighbors’ yards, according to the project description.
The project would also include trees that are “planted strategically” at the rear fence to obscure the sight line and a 7-foot-tall fence with a trellis to help maintain privacy, according to the application.

"Tunisia: Mahdia Beaches in Central-Eastern Tunisia Increasingly Attracting Sea Turtles.

Mahdia/Tunisia — Fourteen nests of loggerhead sea turtles, known as ""Caretta Caretta"", were discovered on Saturday on the beaches of El Ghadabna, El Manakaa and El Khamara in the Mahdia region (central-eastern Tunisia).

President of the association ""Notre Grand Bleu"", Ahmed Ghedira, said this discovery is of great ecological importance. ""The main nesting and hatching sites for these turtles were the Kuriat Islands in Monastir. This proves that the beaches of Mahdia are also becoming popular nesting and hatching sites for this species,"" said Ghedira.

Ghedira emphasised the need to launch a media and awareness campaign aimed at the general public and the local authorities concerned in order to preserve the beaches and nesting and hatching sites of these turtles.

He pointed out that these beaches are already heavily polluted by waste, especially plastic.

He added that after the hatching process (50 days after the eggs are laid), an event should be held to release the baby turtles back into the sea.

The loggerhead turtle Caretta Caretta, the most common turtle in the Mediterranean, nests mainly on the beaches of Greece, Turkey, Libya and Cyprus.

Currently, studies based on the monitoring of various Mediterranean nesting sites estimate that approximately 7200 loggerhead nests and 1500 green turtle nests are deposited each year during the nesting season (Casale and Margaritoulis, 2010), according to a 2013 monitoring study by APAL and UNEP on ""Nesting of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta Caretta on the Kuriat Islands in Tunisia"".

"How the Federal Government Can Rein In A.I. in Law Enforcement.

One of the most hopeful proposals involving police surveillance emerged recently from a surprising quarter — the federal Office of Management and Budget. The office, which oversees the execution of the president’s policies, has recommended sorely needed constraints on the use of artificial intelligence by federal agencies, including law enforcement.

The office’s work is commendable, but shortcomings in its proposed guidance to agencies could still leave people vulnerable to harm. Foremost among them is a provision that would allow senior officials to seek waivers by arguing that the constraints would hinder law enforcement. Those law enforcement agencies should instead be required to provide verifiable evidence that A.I. tools they or their vendors use will not cause harm, worsen discrimination or violate people’s rights.

As scholars of algorithmic tools, policing and constitutional law, we have witnessed the predictable and preventable harms from law enforcement’s use of emerging technologies. These include false arrests and police seizures, including a family held at gunpoint, after people were wrongly accused of crimes because of the irresponsible use of A.I.-driven technologies including facial recognition and automated license plate readers.

Consider the cases of Porcha Woodruff, Michael Oliver and Robert Julian-Borchak Williams. All were arrested between 2019 and 2023 after they were misidentified by facial recognition technology. These arrests had indelible ­­­consequences: Ms. Woodruff was eight months pregnant when she was falsely accused of carjacking and robbery; Mr. Williams was arrested in front of his wife and two young daughters as he pulled into his driveway from work. Mr. Oliver lost his job as a result.

All are Black. This should not be a surprise. A 2018 study co-written by one of us (Dr. Buolamwini) found that three commercial facial-analysis programs from major technology companies showed both skin-type and gender biases. The darker the skin, the more often the errors arose. Questions of fairness and bias persist about the use of these sorts of technologies.

Errors happen because law enforcement deploys emerging technologies without transparency or community agreement that they should be used at all, with little or no consideration of the consequences, insufficient training and inadequate guardrails. Often the data sets that drive the technologies are infected with errors and racial bias. Typically, the officers or agencies face no consequences for false arrests, increasing the likelihood they will continue.

The Office of Management and Budget guidance, which is now being finalized after a period of public comment, would apply to law enforcement technologies such as facial recognition, license-plate readers, predictive policing tools, gunshot detection, social media monitoring and more. It sets out criteria for A.I. technologies that, without safeguards, could put people’s safety or well-being at risk or violate their rights. If these proposed “minimum practices” are not met, technologies that fall short would be prohibited after next Aug. 1.

Here are highlights of the proposal: Agencies must be transparent and provide a public inventory of cases in which A.I. was used. The cost and benefit of these technologies must be assessed, a consideration that has been altogether absent. Even if the technology provides real benefits, the risks to individuals — especially in marginalized communities — must be identified and reduced. If the risks are too high, the technology may not be used. The impact of A.I.-driven technologies must be tested in the real world, and be continually monitored. Agencies would have to solicit public comment before using the technologies, including from the affected communities.

The proposed requirements are serious ones. They should have been in place before law enforcement began using these emerging technologies. Given the rapid adoption of these tools, without evidence of equity or efficacy and with insufficient attention to preventing mistakes, we fully anticipate some A.I. technologies will not meet the proposed standards and their use will be banned for noncompliance.

The overall thrust of the federal A.I. initiative is to push for rapid use of untested technologies by law enforcement, an approach that too often fails and causes harm. For that reason, the Office of Management and Budget must play a serious oversight role.

Far and away, the most worrisome elements in the proposal are provisions that create the opportunity for loopholes. For example, the chief A.I. officer of each federal agency could waive proposed protections with nothing more than a justification sent to the Office of Management and Budget. Worse yet, the justification need only claim “an unacceptable impediment to critical agency operations” — the sort of claim law enforcement regularly makes to avoid regulation.

This waiver provision has the potential to wipe away all that the proposal promises. No waiver should be permitted without clear proof that it is essential — proof that in our experience law enforcement typically cannot muster. No one person should have the power to issue such a waiver. There must be careful review to ensure that waivers are legitimate. Unless the recommendations are enforced strictly, we will see more surveillance, more people forced into unjustified encounters with law enforcement, and more harm to communities of color. Technologies that are clearly shown to be discriminatory should not be used.

There is also a vague exception for “national security,” a phrase frequently used to excuse policing from legal protections for civil rights and against discrimination. “National security” requires a sharper definition to prevent the exemption from being invoked without valid cause or oversight.

Finally, nothing in this proposal applies beyond federal government agencies. The F.B.I., the Transportation Security Administration and other federal agencies are aggressively embracing facial recognition and other biometric technologies that can recognize individuals by their unique physical characteristics. But so are state and local agencies, which do not fall under these guidelines. The federal government regularly offers federal funding as a carrot to win compliance from state and local agencies with federal rules. It should do the same here.

We hope the Office of Management and Budget will set a higher standard at the federal level for law enforcement’s use of emerging technologies, a standard that state and local governments should also follow.

Over the five decades that followed, she became a pillar of the school community, known not only for her exceptional teaching skills but also for her unwavering commitment to the success and well-being of her students.

The retirement ceremony, held in the school's auditorium, was a bittersweet moment for Miss Pat and those who have had the privilege of working alongside her. Colleagues praised her tireless efforts to create a nurturing and inclusive learning environment, fostering a sense of curiosity and a love for knowledge among her students.

Former students, now adults with families of their own, attended the ceremony to express their gratitude for the impact Miss Pat had on their lives. Many shared heartfelt anecdotes, recounting the ways in which she inspired them to pursue their dreams and overcome challenges.

The school administration presented Miss Pat with a lifetime achievement award, recognizing her outstanding contributions to education. In her farewell speech, she expressed gratitude for the years of fulfilling experiences and shared her hopes for the continued success of Memorial Elementary.

"‘Miss Pat’ ends 53-year career at Memorial Elementary.

Despite being in her 90s, Pat Wasemann didn’t want to retire.

But it got to the point where she just had to stop being a noon aide at Memorial Elementary School in the Bethel Park School District – a job she held for more than five decades.

“I guess the Lord told me enough is enough,” Wasemann said recently. “I get tired. I lost the strength in my legs. I can still walk, but I can’t stand very long. I didn’t want to (retire). I wish I was still there. My age kind of crept up on me.”

“Miss Pat,” as she was called, retired at the end of the 2022-23 school year after 53 years at Memorial, where she was beloved by staff and students alike.

Wasemann, who turned 92 on Nov. 15 and still drives, started the job after moving to Bethel Park from Wheeling, W.Va., in 1969. Her daughter Linda, now 63, was a fourth-grade student at the elementary school at the time and told her mother about the opening for a noon aide.

“She gave me a note and said would you like to make some pin money,” Wasemann recalled with a chuckle. “I’m not sure if it was even a dollar an hour at that time. I thought, ‘I can do that.’ I put my application in and of course I got hired. The rest is history.”

Her duties as a noon aide included tending to children in the cafeteria and making sure they were behaving.

“Most of the time we were there for about two hours,” Wasemann said.

For about 20 years, Wasemann also helped with cleaning the building in the summer.

In recent years, Wasemann greeted kindergarten students at the front door as they were dropped off by parents and buses.

She could be found sitting on a bench waiting for the students, a bench that has since been dedicated in her honor as “Miss Pat’s Bench.”

What kept her at the job for so many years?

“It was just getting out of the house, just seeing people, meeting people every day,” Wasemann said.

Among the many friends Wasemann she’s made over the years is Eric Hamilton, the school’s physical education teacher. The two still meet for lunch on occasion.

“His wife lets him go out to lunch once in a while,” she said with a laugh.” I used to see him every day. That’s one of the things that I miss, that I don’t get to see him every day.”

Hamilton has been with the district since 2010, starting as a traveling physical education teacher.

“One day I just sat down and started talking to her. From that point on whenever I was (at Memorial) we were hanging out,” he recalled. “She’s hilarious. She’s sharp as a tack. She’s a great friend. We have great conversations. I’m thankful to be friends with her for this many years.”

During the COVID 19 pandemic, the two would communicate via Zoom and they regularly email one another.

“I have two kids and she loves to hear about them,” Hamilton said. “She was everything to the school. For kindergartners in the afternoon, she was the first face they saw. She saw all the kids at lunch. They all knew Miss Pat. She loved them.”

Eric Chalus, Memorial Elementary School principal for 20 years, agreed that Wasemann meant a great deal to the school. He remembered Wasemann at times standing with her hands on her hips if there was some misbehavior.

“She was like an icon,” he said. “Without Miss Pat, it’s like we’re missing something. She’s been here for so long. She would tell me how to do things. Her sense of humor is unbelievable. The staff loves her to death and the kids love her. It’s not the same without her. I can’t say enough great stuff about her.”

In addition to Hamilton, there is plenty Wasemann misses about being at Memorial.

“(I miss) seeing the people, my aides and my friends,” she said.

Wasemann’s retirement does not mean she is sitting still. She still volunteers weekly with Meals and Wheels, something she has been doing for 51 years, and is still an active member of Faith Lutheran Church in Upper St. Clair.

It was a rewarding ride for Wasemann after 53 years at Memorial Elementary. Some of the parents and grandparents of current students remember Wasemann from their time as students there.

“My biggest reward is seeing them out at the store or somewhere and they remember me,” she said. “Most of the time they have something good to say about me.That’s one of my best rewards is that the students remember me and talk to me.” ",https://www.thealmanac.net/bethel-park/2023/dec/17/miss-pat-ends-53-year-career-at-memorial-elementary/,real,0

"Santa Clara County providing free Narcan by mail to residents.

In a groundbreaking move aimed at addressing the opioid crisis, Santa Clara County has recently introduced a program to distribute free Narcan, a life-saving opioid overdose reversal medication, to its residents through the mail.

The initiative, spearheaded by local health authorities and supported by community organizations, comes as part of a broader effort to combat opioid-related emergencies and fatalities. With opioid overdoses on the rise, the county is taking proactive measures to ensure that residents have access to the necessary tools to respond effectively in case of an overdose.

Under this program, Santa Clara County residents can now request a free Narcan kit to be delivered directly to their homes. The user-friendly kit includes step-by-step instructions on how to administer Narcan, making it accessible even to those without medical training. Health officials emphasize the importance of having Narcan readily available, as rapid intervention can significantly increase the chances of saving a life during an opioid overdose.

The decision to provide Narcan by mail is seen as a strategic response to the challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. By offering this service remotely, the county aims to reach a broader audience and ensure that individuals, particularly those who may be hesitant to visit public spaces due to health concerns, can still access this critical medication.

Local leaders commend the initiative for its potential to make a positive impact on the community. Supervisor [Supervisor Name] stated, ""This program is a crucial step in our commitment to public health and safety. By making Narcan readily available to residents, we are empowering our community to play an active role in preventing opioid-related tragedies.""

The program aligns with broader public health efforts to reduce the stigma associated with substance use disorders and prioritize harm reduction strategies. In addition to providing Narcan, the county is also focusing on educational outreach to raise awareness about the signs of opioid overdose and the importance of seeking help.

Residents interested in obtaining a free Narcan kit can visit the official Santa Clara County health department website or contact the dedicated hotline for assistance. The county encourages everyone to take advantage of this initiative, emphasizing that having Narcan on hand can save lives and contribute to the overall well-being of the community.","generate the news article corresponding to the title ""Santa Clara County providing free Narcan by mail to residents""",fake,1
"Santa Clara County providing free Narcan by mail to residents.

With fentanyl and other opioids continuing to take a deadly toll on the country, Santa Clara County has begun distributing Narcan, the opioid overdose-reversing nasal spray, by mail to residents free of charge.

Narcan, also known by its generic name naloxone, was approved by the FDA last year for use without a prescription and has become a popular tool for local governments and schools looking to curb the number of opioid overdoses. But the life-saving medicine comes with a hefty price tag with out of pocket costs ranging from $70 to $150.
Santa Clara County has already stocked free Narcan in several of its libraries, making the mail-order effort just the latest initiative to combat the opioid crisis.

Anjanette DeVito, the nurse manager for the county’s addiction medicine and therapy programs, said that since Dec. 1, the county has fulfilled nearly 60 requests — or 120 kits — of Narcan. Residents interested in obtaining Narcan can contact the county at 408-272-6055 or SCCOOPP@hhs.sccgov.org, and the county will send the nasal spray out within 24 hours.

DeVito said the mail order Narcan isn’t just another way to get the medicine in more people’s hands — but a way to train them how to use it, as well.

“For someone who doesn’t have the time during the work day this was another avenue to make the medication or the training available,” she said. “When we receive an email or phone call that someone is interested in our mail order program we provide them with the manufacturers training video through email link and a QR code both through the email and also on the box.”

Supervisor Cindy Chavez said adding a mail order program was the logical next step as many residents are already used to getting their prescriptions or COVID-19 tests in the mail.

In her conversations with residents, she’s learned that not everyone feels comfortable picking up Narcan at their local library out of fear that others might think they’re a drug user themselves.

“Even if they’re not drug users, they’re around people who are and so a lot of the folks who are requesting this aren’t using drugs themselves but have friends or family who do,” Chavez said. “Being somebody who is responsible, just wanting to be ready just like you would take a CPR class, that’s how we’re wanting to make it feel.”

With fentanyl killing a record number of Californians in 2022, the state in recent years has ratcheted up efforts to fight the opioid crisis with a slate of new laws.

A new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year requires public and charter schools to create safety plans about how they would handle a student having an opioid overdose on campus. Community colleges and state universities now have to provide fentanyl test strips to students, as well.

Santa Clara County also provides free in-person trainings and Narcan at several county clinics. For more information visit www.sccgov.org/sccoopp.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/01/08/santa-clara-county-providing-free-narcan-by-mail/,real,0
"All Pa. school districts could see funding increases under billion-dollar K-12 plan, education advocates say.

In a groundbreaking development, education advocates are touting a billion-dollar K-12 plan that has the potential to bring about substantial funding increases for all school districts across Pennsylvania. The proposal, if implemented, promises to address longstanding issues related to education funding and pave the way for improved educational opportunities for students statewide.

Under the comprehensive K-12 plan, every school district in Pennsylvania stands to benefit from increased financial support. Education advocates argue that this infusion of funds is crucial for addressing disparities in resources and ensuring that every student, regardless of their geographical location, has access to a high-quality education.

The billion-dollar initiative aims to allocate funds strategically, taking into account the unique needs and challenges faced by individual school districts. Proponents of the plan argue that such an approach is essential for fostering a more equitable education system, where schools in underserved communities receive the necessary resources to thrive.

While the plan has garnered widespread support from education advocates, it is not without its critics. Some skeptics question the feasibility of such a massive financial commitment and raise concerns about the potential impact on taxpayers. However, proponents argue that the long-term benefits of investing in education far outweigh the initial costs.

The proposed K-12 plan is expected to address not only basic funding needs but also to target specific areas such as teacher salaries, classroom resources, and infrastructure improvements. By addressing these key areas, the plan aims to enhance the overall learning environment for students and empower educators to provide a more enriching educational experience.

As discussions surrounding the billion-dollar K-12 plan unfold, policymakers, educators, and community members are closely monitoring the developments. The potential for positive change in Pennsylvania's education landscape has sparked optimism among many who believe that this ambitious initiative could be a transformative step towards a more equitable and prosperous future for the state's students.

The fate of the billion-dollar K-12 plan now rests in the hands of legislators and policymakers, who will play a pivotal role in determining the future of education funding in Pennsylvania. With the promise of increased support for all school districts, the plan holds the potential to reshape the educational trajectory for countless students and contribute to the overall well-being of communities across the state.","generate a news article with title ""All Pa. school districts could see funding increases under billion-dollar K-12 plan, education advocates say""",fake,1
"All Pa. school districts could see funding increases under billion-dollar K-12 plan, education advocates say.

All of Pennsylvania’s 500 school districts would receive more state funding if hefty increases in K-12 allotments are greenlit by state lawmakers, education advocates in favor of the funding boost said during a news conference on Friday.

Under the report endorsed by the Basic Education Funding Commission, these increased funds would also target low-wealth school districts, according to advocates with the PA Schools Work coalition.

“We heard from school officials about what they need to support their students: reading and math specialists, support for multilingual students, AP classes at low-wealth school districts … counselors, librarians and teachers,” Sharon Ward, a senior policy advisor with the Education Law Center of Pennsylvania, said during the conference. “This funding will help to ensure that all school districts are able to provide these critical student services.”

The report — endorsed by a mostly partisan, split vote on Thursday — threw its weight behind “adequacy” investments that would increase statewide, annual spending by $5.4 billion over a seven-year period.

It also calls on lawmakers to provide an additional $200 million in basic education funding over the next few years. The state’s basic education funding currently sits at around $7.8 billion.

The report is the result of a Commonwealth Court ruling last year that found the state’s current education funding system is unconstitutional.

Those in favor of the report believe its approach could transform education in the state. Donna Cooper — executive director of Children First, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that supports public education — called the report a “significant step toward repairing the state's broken and unconstitutional public school funding system” during Friday’s conference.

Opponents, meanwhile, have raised concerns over the proposition’s price tag and results. Numerous Republican lawmakers, who control the state Senate, expressed doubts on Thursday that these funds would actually resolve the state’s educational shortcomings.

And Kevin Kane —director of legislative strategy for the Commonwealth Foundation, a Harrisburg-based nonprofit that advocates for school choice — said in a Thursday news release that the recommendations will lead to higher taxes and won’t improve educational outcomes.

“The report is a laundry list of special interest spending proposals, rather than a serious attempt to help Pennsylvania’s students,” Mr. Kane said in a statement.

Democrats have argued it is possible for the state to come up with the billions of dollars, citing a balance of about $12 billion in the state’s general fund and $6.2 billion in its Rainy Day Fund.

Of the 15-person commission that considered the report, eight members — including five Democrats and three representatives for Gov. Josh Shapiro — supported it. Mr. Shapiro, who voiced his support for the report after its approval, said he will address its points during his 2024-25 budget address next month.

The commission’s six Republicans, who unsuccessfully presented a separate report, voted against the endorsed report.

One Democrat, Sen. Lindsey Williams of Allegheny County, voted against both reports.

“I cannot in good faith vote for a compromise report that will ultimately serve as the starting point for budget negotiations,” Ms. Williams said on Thursday. “I did not want the public to look at a unanimous Democratic-only report and think that it represents our shared goals for this year’s budget. It does not.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2024/01/13/pennsylvania-education-advocates-school-funding-report/stories/202401120095,real,0
"How I Customized My Kindle for the Coziest Reading Sessions of My Life.

I love to read, always have. Across physical, audio, and ebook formats, I typically read north of 50 books a year. And while I love my Kindle for its portability and the access to dozens of volumes at the click of a button, the experience is not quite the same as curling up with a good old-fashioned paperback. The words are there, yes, but the vibe could use an upgrade. Fueled by my unending desire to be a human burrito, I turned my Kindle into a cozy hands-free reading machine, and though it may seem a little over the top, it’s one of the best things I’ve done in my bibliophilic life.
If you want to have the ultimate cozy Kindle reading experience and fully engage in bed-rot-style literary luxury, consider the Lamicall Gooseneck Tablet Holder, which gets me one step closer to my ultimate human-burrito goal.

I chose it from many options on Amazon after comparing reviews and deciding that it looked the least like an office-supply-store reject (even though it literally is an office-supply item). Just think: How many times have you dropped your book, e- or otherwise, on your face while reading in bed, either because you started dozing off or because, oops, the weight of knowledge is heavy and sometimes slippery?

This gooseneck mount attaches to your bed frame or bedside table via an adjustable clamp that you can tighten easily by hand and can bend to hold your tablet in the perfect position in perpetuity, with no danger to your schnoz. The arm is plenty long to swoop into any position that my reclining self desires, and it’s sturdy enough that it doesn’t budge once positioned.

On the flip side, it takes a bit of muscling to move the arm to where I want it, but that rigidity also allows me to stash this bad boy under my bed when I’m not using it without losing my hard-won perfect Kindle-reading placement. Note, too, that the spring-loaded tablet holder can also work well for an iPad or phone.

A book remote to turn pages with the press of a button

Picture this: Your Kindle is hovering just where you want it, you’re wrapped up in a blanket, and you don’t have to move a muscle to turn a page. You don’t have to let the cold air into your cocoon. While you remain swaddled like a baby, your Kindle remains motionless in its gooseneck home, unjarred by your constant swiping.

That’s because you’re holding a tiny remote roughly the size of a fun-size Toblerone bar nestled comfortably in the palm of your hand—I use the Syukuyu RF Remote Control Page Turner—and with one click of a button, it communicates via Bluetooth with a small clip on the side of your Kindle and turns the page for you. (The Syukuyu remote is the one model I’ve found that works with a Kindle; the easier-to-find “Bluetooth remotes” you may run across don’t work with the device and are meant to be paired with smartphones.)

Before my remote arrived, I was reaching up and swiping pages to turn. Nestled in its gooseneck home, my Kindle would bob and shake each time.

This Kindle-clamp-and-remote setup is cozy and convenient as heck, as well as a boon for accessibility and those who may have difficulty holding a book up for a long time or who have certain positions that they’re more comfortable in. It is, quite simply, a reader’s dream.

Take your cozy e-reader on the go

If you’re thinking I can’t take this show on the road, think again. I found a goofy-looking bendable around-the-neck mount, which I’ve shoved into a backpack and brought on trips with me to approximate my at-home setup. It can also function as a tabletop stand for a phone or a Kindle, and you can use it while reclining or sitting up, no table necessary.

It’s a little less versatile than the full gooseneck-clamp arrangement, which is to be expected, but it works great for holding a book near my face. The foam around the neck is comfy enough, the mount is easy to reposition, and it comes in a few cute colors. It’s also so well priced that it’s a low-stakes gift.

Though some people (my husband) say that my setup looks like the scene where WALL-E discovers the beached humans in their VR wonderlands, I think there are much worse ways to look silly than committing to a long, comfy sit-down with a book.",https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/best-kindle-accessories/?campaign_id=290&emc=edit_wcd_20240114&instance_id=112370&nl=the-recommendation&regi_id=219336962&segment_id=155295&user_id=e2818a485582bb9869f061dc38fa6f7a,real,0
"How I Customized My Kindle for the Coziest Reading Sessions of My Life.

As an avid reader and a bit of a tech enthusiast, I've always sought the perfect reading experience. But what I achieved with my Kindle goes beyond the ordinary – it's a journey into the surreal, almost sci-fi realm of quantum mechanics.

It began as a simple project: to enhance my Kindle for more comfortable reading. However, with a background in physics and a daring spirit, I decided to push the boundaries. I integrated a miniature quantum computer into my Kindle. The idea was not just to increase its processing power but to experiment with quantum probabilities to transform how I interacted with stories.

Imagine opening your Kindle and not just choosing a book but a universe. The quantum-enhanced Kindle doesn't just display text; it calculates and presents a story that aligns with your current mood, using a complex algorithm that interprets emotional states. This is made possible by the Quantum Mood Sensing (QMS) technology I developed, which reads subtle cues from your body – your pulse, the slight changes in your skin conductivity, even the way you hold the device.

The surreal part begins when you start reading. The narrative alters slightly with each reading, like it's alive. Characters might make different choices, or new subplots emerge, all because the quantum processor explores all possible storylines simultaneously. It's like Schrödinger's cat, but for literature. Each time you open the book, you're not just reading; you're collapsing countless probabilities into one coherent storyline.

But I didn't stop there. I wanted my reading experience to be as immersive as possible. So, I added an Augmented Reality (AR) layer. With a simple voice command, my room transforms into the world of the book. If I'm reading a novel set in Victorian London, the walls of my room flicker and change into cobblestone streets and foggy alleys, complete with ambient sounds.

The final touch was the addition of a Haptic Feedback System. Now, when I read about a character walking on a gravel path, I feel the crunch under my feet through the floor. If there's a breeze in the book, a gentle wind blows across my room.

It's not just reading anymore; it's a full-body, multisensory journey. Each session with my Kindle is a unique adventure, a personal story tailored just for me, in a world that responds and changes. It's the coziest, most engaging reading experience I've ever had, and it's all thanks to a little quantum mechanics and a lot of imagination.

As I continue to refine this technology, I can't help but wonder about the implications. What does this mean for the future of storytelling, of personal entertainment? The possibilities are as vast as the quantum realms I now explore each night with my Kindle in hand. For now, I'm just enjoying the coziest reading sessions of my life, one quantum story at a time.","write a realistic journal article in the style of New York Times titled: ""How I Customized My Kindle for the Coziest Reading Sessions of My Life""

The five sites Johnston created in the past six months to house people living in tent cities in downtown Denver are intended as temporary housing. Johnston says the goal is for folks to stay for 60 to 90 days before they are moved to permanent housing.
Then, that temporary housing unit will open up for someone else who is living on the streets or in congregate shelters. This is crucial. While downtown has been emptied of the encampments, the city’s congregate shelters are still full, people living in abject poverty are still spending their days on the streets, and there are scattered encampments outside of the Central Business District.

The city was able to round up 500 housing vouchers using state and federal programs for some of the first crop of House 1,000 residents. The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless has amped up hiring caseworkers to run the temporary housing facilities. Johnston said the next step is to increase the level of services at the facilities so people can get the help they need.

Already, the city has spent about $49 million to acquire the five old hotels and two sites for small pallet homes. Another $40 million will be needed next year to house an additional 1,000 people. Plus the city needs to step up addiction treatment and counseling.
How did Johnston achieve in six months what has alluded the city since encampments started popping up in the early financial chaos of COVID lockdowns and in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests?

Johnston doubled down on the previous administration’s plans: Where it’d taken Mayor Michael Hancock years to site individual safe outdoor spaces that housed 40 tents, Johnston was able to use an emergency declaration to allocate the funds he needed to acquire hotels and get them rezoned quickly to be used as housing for 1,100 people. Two more sites that utilize pallet home structures will house an additional 120 people.

But Johnston also held 60 community meetings in the past six months, where he personally worked to assuage the fears of Denver residents about having a temporary housing facility in their neighborhood. There are still obstacles standing between Johnston and opening enough sites to house a total of 2,000 people, and a lot of that will require the first seven sites to be safe and successful in their neighborhoods.
“It has to be structured so it was a win-win for both the people who are unhoused and the neighbors,” Johnston said. “While well-intentioned, the previous cycle of opening one or two new units and bringing one or two people off the street at a time, you can’t actually digest the amount of volume there is.”

Some of what Johnston wants to accomplish will be achieved with a redeployment of resources — he noted there were 8,000 service calls last year to homeless encampments and that street teams who provided resources to the encampments will be able to spend their time in the shelters instead.

This is a delicate time for Johnston’s plan, for downtown Denver and for 1,100 people who could be on the cusp of regaining housing and building a bright future with endless possibilities.

We’re rooting for everyone to succeed, and if you believe in this effort too, you can help by donating to The Denver Foundation’s House 1,000 fund. Johnston is pulling from Denver taxpayer dollars, federal dollars and state resources.

But he is also battling a second crisis — thousands of refugees, mostly from Venezuela, who have arrived in Denver. As of Tuesday, the mayor told us 4,800 refugees were in temporary shelters and more are arriving every day.

“We want to be a welcoming city,” Johnston said. But the city is on track to spend $180 million in 2024 to care for the refugees, and soon, city departments will have to face cuts, or the refugees will have to be denied services if the federal government doesn’t step up to help.

These pressures on an already tight affordable housing market may prove too much for the system in the next six months if something doesn’t change.",https://www.denverpost.com/2024/01/16/denver-homeless-new-mayor-house-1000-encampments-closed/,real,0
"Editorial: Mayor Johnston transformed downtown Denver in 6 months. Is it sustainable?.

In just six months, Mayor Johnston's ambitious urban revitalization plan has dramatically transformed the landscape of downtown Denver. The changes are not just cosmetic; they represent a fundamental shift in the city's approach to urban development, sustainability, and community engagement.

The centerpiece of Mayor Johnston's plan was the ""Green Corridor"" initiative, which turned several downtown streets into pedestrian-only zones, lined with local businesses, green spaces, and public art installations. This initiative not only boosted local commerce but also reduced traffic congestion and pollution, creating a more welcoming and environmentally friendly downtown area.

Another notable achievement is the overhaul of the public transportation system. The introduction of electric buses and expanded bike lanes has made commuting more accessible and sustainable. These changes align with Denver's broader goals of reducing its carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly transportation options.

However, as we celebrate these achievements, we must also ask: Is this rapid transformation sustainable in the long run? Critics argue that the pace of change has been too fast, leaving little time for proper assessment and community feedback. There are concerns about the long-term financial viability of these projects, especially given the substantial upfront investment required.

Moreover, the focus on downtown areas has led to criticisms of neglecting other neighborhoods, especially those in dire need of infrastructure and economic development. Balancing downtown revitalization with city-wide inclusive growth remains a challenge.

In conclusion, while Mayor Johnston's efforts in transforming downtown Denver have been commendable, the true test will be in sustaining these changes and addressing the concerns that have emerged. It's a bold vision, but it requires careful management, continuous community involvement, and a balanced approach to urban development to ensure its success and sustainability.

"City explores preservation, rehab of Lear Theater.

In an exciting development for local heritage, the city council has announced plans to preserve and rehabilitate the historic Lear Theater, a beloved landmark in the community's cultural landscape.

The Lear Theater, with its striking Art Deco design, has been at the heart of the city's arts scene since its establishment. However, facing the ravages of time and changing public interests, the theater has seen better days. This new initiative aims to breathe life back into this architectural and cultural icon.

The comprehensive rehabilitation plan includes structural renovations to ensure safety and longevity, upgrading technical equipment to meet modern standards, and redesigning interior spaces to enhance audience experience. Importantly, these improvements will be carried out with a careful eye on retaining the theater's historic charm and character.

Funding for this ambitious project is a testament to community spirit and collaboration. It combines city funds, state cultural grants, and generous donations from local arts patrons. The project underscores a shared commitment to preserving the city's cultural heritage.

Local arts organizations have welcomed this initiative with enthusiasm. The Lear Theater has been a foundational stage for numerous local artists and performers, and its revival is seen as a boost to the city's vibrant arts scene. ""The Lear Theater has been the starting point for many creative journeys in our community. Its restoration is not just a boon for the arts but a rekindling of our collective history,"" a renowned local theater director commented.

The restoration process is expected to unfold over the next few months, culminating in a grand reopening that promises to be a major event in the city's cultural calendar. The rejuvenated Lear Theater is poised to not only honor its illustrious past but also to become a dynamic hub for future artistic expression.

For residents and arts enthusiasts eager to follow the theater's transformation or contribute to the project, updates and donation information will be available through the city's cultural affairs website and the Lear Theater's official channels.","generate a news article with the given title: City explores preservation, rehab of Lear Theater",fake,1
"City explores preservation, rehab of Lear Theater.

The City of Reno this month launched a bid process for the development of a historic structure report of the Lear Theater, which it purchased from Artown in 2021. The report will provide the city with an assessment of the historic building’s current condition, repair and maintenance needs, and options for development as either a performing arts or community arts and culture center.

The final report is scheduled to be presented to the city later this year.

Local historian Alicia Barber said the report is a critical step and long overdue.“ The Historical Resources Commission and community members like myself have been urging the City to commission a Historic Structure Report since they first acquired the building from Artown, but they didn’t take any steps to do that until quite recently,” Barber said. “But it’s a critical step and long overdue. “This kind of professional, comprehensive report is essential to assess the current condition of the building, outline what it will take to bring it back to a functioning state and evaluate various options for its reuse.”

Barber credited City Council member Naomi Duerr for working with city staff to move the project forward. 

The building, originally the First Church of Christ, Scientist, is historically significant and was designed by famed architect Paul Revere Williams, the first African-American member of the American Institute of Architects. It’s on several historic registers.  However, it has been essentially vacant since 1998 when the church congregation moved to a larger location. Over the years, nearly $8 million has been spent on repairs and maintenance to the building. Artown took over the building in 2011 with plans to transform it into a performing arts center. That didn’t happen.
A feasibility study completed in 2013 suggested that bringing the building up to code and renovating and equipping it to be a performing arts center would cost $7.5 million—adjusting for inflation, that would be about $10 million today. 

By 2018, Artown was still soliciting feedback from the community on potential uses and support for the theater. In 2020, Artown announced it was working with local developer Ken Krater on a plan to rehab the theater and build up to 50 apartments next to it—on part of Riverside Drive that would need to be abandoned—to create an income stream for the theater.
Those plans didn’t sit well with the community, with some calling it “outrageous.” 

“As much as we all want the Lear renovated, everyone should be alarmed at what this proposal would do to the public streets around it,” Barber wrote in an email to Our Town Reno. 

The non-profit Preserve Nevada placed the Lear on its list of Nevada’s 11 Most Endangered Places, with board chair and former Nevada governor Richard Bryan pleading to the Reno City Council. 

“We urge all of those involved to do their best to protect the history and beauty of Riverside Drive along the Truckee River and continue to work together on behalf of preserving the Lear Theater and its intrinsic value to the past and present to the Reno area,” he wrote.

Over the years, the building has faced vandalism. Last year City Council members approved $1 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to clean and inspect the property, repair the landscaping and any other damage and add security cameras and fencing to the property to fend off additional vandalism. Most of the work will be completed later this spring, according to the city.

Part of the approved ARPA funds will cover the cost of the historic structure report.

City spokesperson Landon Miller said the City Council “has not allocated or identified additional funding” to cover the costs of ongoing maintenance of the Lear Theater, much less fund the millions of dollars in improvements it would need to become ready for community arts events. He added that more direction will come once the historical structure report is complete.

In 2022, the city estimated it only had the budget to cover 78% of the maintenance costs of its existing facilities. Most of the city’s buildings aren’t receiving even half of the staff time required for maintenance.",https://thisisreno.com/2024/01/city-explores-preservation-rehab-of-lear-theater/,real,0
"Akron area became home to more than 500 new refugees in 2023, International Institute says.


In the year 2023, the Akron area opened its doors and expanded its cultural mosaic by welcoming over 500 new refugees, according to a recent report released by the International Institute. This influx marks a significant increase from previous years, reflecting the area's growing reputation as a sanctuary for those seeking a new beginning.

The report details that these individuals have arrived from various global hotspots of conflict and hardship, each carrying stories of resilience and hope. As they settle into the Akron community, local organizations have mobilized to provide essential support services, including language classes, employment assistance, and housing resources, ensuring a smoother transition for the newcomers.

The International Institute, a pillar in the refugee resettlement efforts, has been instrumental in this process. The Institute’s spokesperson highlighted that their mission extends beyond mere resettlement; it aims to foster an environment of inclusion and integration, enabling the refugees to become active and contributing members of the community.

Local residents and businesses alike have shown remarkable support, with many volunteering time and resources to assist the new members of their community. Schools have also adapted to the increasing diversity, introducing multicultural programs to promote understanding and acceptance among students.

The city's demographics are changing as a result of this wave of new residents, with a rich variety of languages and cultures now represented. Restaurants, shops, and cultural festivals have sprung up, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of the refugees and adding to the economic and social vibrancy of Akron.

The article concludes by spotlighting the success stories emerging from the refugee community, showcasing individuals who have started their own businesses or who have excelled academically, thus enriching the social fabric of Akron with their ambitions and talents.

As the International Institute and Akron prepare for the possibility of more arrivals in the future, the community stands as a testament to the strength found in diversity and the enduring spirit of American hospitality.","given the news title ""Akron area became home to more than 500 new refugees in 2023, International Institute says"", generate a news article for me.",fake,1
"Akron area became home to more than 500 new refugees in 2023, International Institute says.

The Akron area continues to provide new hope and opportunity for hundreds of people leaving behind violent conflict or dire circumstances across the globe.

The International Institute of Akron says it resettled 518 new refugees in 2023, with the largest segments coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Sudan. Hundreds more received assistance through the nonprofit's immigration legal services, employment resources, extended social services, education and interpreting and translation.

The organization has been a crucial hub of support as the Nepali and Bhutanese refugee community has flourished — particularly in Akron's North Hill and surrounding neighborhoods — in recent years. And while the influx of newcomers is likely to continue steadily, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants — a nongovernmental organization and national partner of the International Institute — sees a geographic shift coming.
""In 2024, we expect our numbers to be roughly what they were in 2023,"" said Kevin Walter, the International Institute's advocacy and community outreach coordinator. He said the USCRI has advised ""that we can anticipate an increase in refugee arrivals from Central and South American countries.""

Despite some challenges, including and especially in finding affordable, safe housing, Walter said the International Institute is ready for 2024.

""We are always in need of donated items for our housing setups,"" Walter said. ""The biggest ongoing needs are new pillows, bedding, pots and pans, cleaning products, and personal hygiene items. Grocery store gift cards are always appreciated, as they allow the recipients to make their own food choices.""
The organization's growth and its increasing workload fed into last year's move from North Hill to Canal Place in downtown Akron.

""Things are working out great at our new location,"" Walter said. ""The increased space has allowed us to build capacity, and being located a short walk from the central Metro transportation hub has made it easier for clients from all over Akron to access our office.""
Walter said the International Institute is preparing to host a community event to celebrate the new location at 530 S. Main St., Suite 1762.

""We do not have an exact date for the open house yet, but it will be in the spring when the weather improves,"" he said. ""Most likely closer to our one year anniversary in the new space.""

The International Institute also continues to operates an education office and classrooms at 471 Schiller Ave. in Akron, he said.",https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/local/2024/01/17/international-institute-helps-refugees-resettle-akron-ohio-2023-census-numbers/72189205007/,real,0
"Fremont's iconic Mission Peak pole vandalized, missing top half found.


In a shocking turn of events, Fremont's renowned landmark, Mission Peak, has fallen victim to vandalism as its iconic pole was discovered severed at the top. Authorities are currently investigating the incident, trying to unravel the mystery behind this act of destruction that has left the community in disbelief.

The Mission Peak pole, a symbol of the city's pride and a popular hiking destination, was found with its upper half missing early this morning. Local residents and frequent visitors were taken aback by the sight, as the distinctive landmark has long been a source of inspiration and identity for the Fremont community.

Officials from the Fremont Police Department were immediately dispatched to the scene to assess the extent of the damage and gather evidence related to the incident. Initial reports suggest that the act of vandalism may have occurred overnight, catching both authorities and the public by surprise.

Mission Peak, known for its panoramic views of the Bay Area, has attracted hikers, nature enthusiasts, and photographers for years. The severed pole has left a noticeable void atop the peak, and the missing section has reportedly been located nearby. Investigators are working diligently to determine the motives behind this deliberate act and identify those responsible.

City officials and community leaders have expressed their disappointment and outrage over the senseless act of vandalism. Mayor [Mayor's Name] condemned the perpetrators, stating, ""Mission Peak is a cherished symbol of our city, and this act of vandalism is not just an attack on a landmark but an affront to our community's shared identity.""

Efforts are already underway to assess the structural integrity of the remaining pole and formulate a plan for its restoration. The Fremont community has rallied together, with many expressing their determination to see Mission Peak restored to its former glory.

As the investigation unfolds, residents are urged to report any suspicious activity they may have witnessed in the vicinity of Mission Peak in the days leading up to the incident. The Fremont Police Department has established a dedicated hotline for tips related to the case, encouraging community collaboration to bring the vandals to justice.

The incident has sparked conversations about the importance of preserving local landmarks and the need for increased vigilance to prevent such acts of vandalism in the future. As the community grapples with the aftermath, the resilience and unity of Fremont residents are likely to play a pivotal role in the restoration of Mission Peak's iconic symbol.","generate a news article with the following title: Fremont's iconic Mission Peak pole vandalized, missing top half found",fake,1
"Fremont's iconic Mission Peak pole vandalized, missing top half found.

FREMONT, Calif. (KGO) -- A popular landmark on top of Mission Peak has been vandalized, according to park officials.

Hikers tell ABC7 News the Mission Peak pole, known to some as the ""Peeker Pole,"" famous for hikers to take photos with when reaching the top, has been cut in half. However, the part that was cut off has been found by park staff.

""I just can't imagine what would be going through someone's mind that would compel them to do that because it's not just a landmark, people interact with it,"" Joyce Lee, a Fremont resident said.

Lee says the one-of-a-kind pole, first installed in 1990, has four faces, showing you the directions of North and South and is covered in 'peeker' holes so you can see other iconic peaks around the Bay Area.

Underneath the pole is a time capsule with a bottle of local wine, an Ohlone charm stone replica, and photos and articles from the late 1980s and 1990s according to East Bay Regional Park District officials.

Lee believes it was cut off sometime between sundown on Friday and sunrise on Saturday.

""This was premeditated, you need a specific tool to cut something like that down, you need to spend time to bring yourself up 2,100 feet over three miles, it's not a low-effort crime,"" Lee said.

A symbol she's visited for decades and not only serves as the marking place for reaching the summit that everyone gets a photo with, but it's been there for every holiday, birthday and even tea party.

""Even though it's a thing, it's along with us through life's journeys,"" she said.

Claudia Bejarano out of Tracy says she had just hiked the same trail last weekend, even snapping a few photos.

But this time she was disappointed by the time she reached the top on Labor Day to find the decapitated pole.

""It's really upsetting because that's the peak, that's where you know that you finally made it up, it's on top of where all the rocks are, all the people kind of gather up just for that picture but not anymore,"" Bejarano said.

Other hikers said this incident of vandalism didn't keep crowds away from seeing the damage for themselves.

""Quite the shame!"" Brad Garofalo, a San Jose resident said. ""If the intent was to stop people from coming, clearly it failed because today's packed.""

The East Bay Regional Park District issued a statement saying:

""We are saddened to learn about this incident in our park. Any vandalism from destruction to graffiti affects what should be a positive, happy experience for community members to enjoy open space and the many trails in our regional parks. Anyone with information about this incident can contact EBRPD's Public Safety Department at 510-690-6521.""",https://abc7news.com/mission-peak-pole-missioin-vanalism-cut-in-half-fremont/13736255/,real,0
"Biden stops by Pennsylvania stores to talk up his record on small business creation.

President Joe Biden on Friday tried his hand at retail politics — stopping in a trio of Pennsylvania stores to stress the value of small businesses and talk up his economic record.

It was a distinct change from the set speeches that the Democratic president usually gives to highlight his policies about an economy with strong employment but levels of inflation that worry voters. Biden gladhanded and joshed at a running shoe store, bicycle shop and coffee house in Emmaus, Pennsylvania.

“My name is Joe Biden and I work for the governor and the senator,” the president said as he stepped into the Nowhere Coffee Co. along with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania. Biden ordered what appeared to be a mango smoothie. Obviously, the people in the coffee house knew who he was, with one of them joking, “This is a normal day.”

Sauntering along Main Street, Biden seemed to be in full campaign mode several months ahead of the November election, which could rematch him against his 2020 opponent, former President Donald Trump.

Biden won the surrounding Lehigh County with 53.2% of the vote in 2020, helping him to secure a victory in Pennsylvania and the White House. It's a state that he will likely need again this year to win reelection.

Biden's pitch Friday was that he's been better for small businesses than Trump, a billionaire, real estate magnate and reality television host who won the presidency in 2016 on the premise that he knows how to grow the economy.

At the Emmaus Run Inn, Biden stressed what he saw as a key difference. There have been 16 million applications to start new businesses during the first three years of his presidency, which he noted is the highest number on record.

Shapiro, Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, said that Biden discussed with the shop owners the running habits of his wife, Jill, and the kinds of bikes that he enjoys riding.

“It was cool for him to be able to see the small businesses that power our economy and the folks behind that,” Shapiro said.

The president also faced national security questions from the scrum of reporters that trailed him. He said the United States and its allies were not in a proxy war with Iran after a missile attack on Houthis who have threatened ships in the Red Sea.

As he left the coffee shop, the president noted that his birthplace was just 90 minutes away.

“By the way, we're almost in heaven, we're almost in Scranton,” he said.",https://www.wtae.com/article/president-biden-pennsylvania-economy-small-businesses/46367163,real,0
"Biden stops by Pennsylvania stores to talk up his record on small business creation.

""Biden Stops by Pennsylvania Stores to Talk Up His Record on Small Business Creation""

In a remarkable display of political theater, President Joe Biden made an unscheduled pit stop at several small businesses in Pennsylvania today. This grand gesture was part of his ongoing effort to showcase his administration's supposedly unparalleled success in fostering small business growth. The scene was almost cinematic: the President, with sleeves rolled up, engaging in what appeared to be heart-to-heart conversations with local entrepreneurs. 

""Look at all these thriving businesses, isn't it just miraculous what we've done?"" said Biden, gesturing broadly at a street lined with shops. ""It's almost like they sprouted up overnight, like magic beans in some kind of economic fairy tale.""

In a bid to underscore his commitment, Biden made sure to remind everyone within earshot about the extensive paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles that his administration had so generously provided for small business owners. ""It's our way of ensuring they get plenty of practice with patience and resilience,"" he quipped, followed by a knowing wink.

At one particularly quaint bookstore, Biden took a moment to reflect on the unprecedented number of small businesses that have opened during his tenure. ""It's simple, really,"" he said, picking up a book titled 'Starting a Business for Dummies.' ""All it takes is a global pandemic, a sprinkle of economic uncertainty, and voilà – you've got the perfect breeding ground for small businesses.""

As he continued his tour, the President was seen explaining to a group of small business owners how the increased tax paperwork was actually a hidden blessing. ""Think of it as a fun puzzle,"" he said. ""Every time you think you've figured it out, we change the rules. Keeps the mind sharp!""

In a particularly touching moment, Biden comforted a small business owner who was on the brink of closure. ""Don't worry,"" he assured them, ""failure is just the first step to a successful government bailout.""

The visit concluded with Biden buying a symbolic lemonade from a child's lemonade stand, declaring it a beacon of American entrepreneurship. ""This right here,"" Biden said, holding up the plastic cup, ""is the future of our economy. A bit sour, perhaps, but nothing a little more sugar – or should I say, government subsidies – can't fix!""

As the motorcade left, trailing a cloud of dust and unanswered questions, one couldn't help but marvel at the President's uncanny ability to put a positive spin on even the most challenging situations. Truly, it was a masterclass in political optimism, or as some might call it, artful sarcasm.","Given a news title ""Biden stops by Pennsylvania stores to talk up his record on small business creation"", generate a news article with the same title and great level of sarcasm.",fake,1

"Artificial Intelligence in Katy: Student describes its use in preparing writing assignments.

In a groundbreaking development at schools within the Katy Independent School District (Katy ISD), students are embracing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their writing assignments. A student from one of the local schools sheds light on the innovative use of AI in the academic realm, providing a glimpse into the future of education.

Katy ISD has introduced AI tools to assist students in preparing writing assignments, marking a shift towards integrating technology into traditional classroom practices. The student, who has experienced firsthand the benefits of AI in writing, shares insights into how these advanced tools are transforming the learning landscape.

According to the student, the AI system analyzes writing prompts, suggests relevant topics, and provides real-time feedback on grammar, structure, and coherence. This not only streamlines the writing process but also empowers students to improve their writing skills with personalized guidance. The use of AI in this context aims to augment the learning experience and help students develop stronger writing capabilities.

Educators within Katy ISD are enthusiastic about the positive impact of AI on student engagement and achievement. The implementation of these tools aligns with the district's commitment to staying at the forefront of educational technology. By incorporating AI into the curriculum, Katy ISD aims to equip students with the skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

While the integration of AI in writing assignments has garnered praise for its potential to enhance educational outcomes, it also raises questions about the role of technology in the learning process. Some may express concerns about the potential reliance on AI and its impact on traditional teaching methods. However, proponents argue that when used thoughtfully, AI can be a valuable tool to complement, rather than replace, the guidance of educators.

The student's account offers a glimpse into the evolving landscape of education, where AI is not just a futuristic concept but a tangible and beneficial resource. As Katy ISD continues to explore innovative approaches to learning, the use of AI in writing assignments is likely to become a focal point for discussions on the intersection of technology and education. The district's embrace of AI reflects a broader trend in education, where schools are leveraging cutting-edge tools to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.","I want to write a news article with the title ""Artificial Intelligence in Katy: Student describes its use in preparing writing assignments"".

"Artificial Intelligence in Katy: Student describes its use in preparing writing assignments.

Years ago, when he was in middle school, Rutva Gupta was part of several student groups that revolved around writing. Today, Gupta is preparing for his senior year at Tompkins High School. He said he wanted to study either engineering or business, and he’s considering Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Texas A&M University, among other colleges.

Artificial intelligence is and will be a part of how he does his classwork to get him there.

“Basically, this past year we’ve seen the release of ChatGPT, and at our school—that’s when this discussion of AI really became this real thing,” Gupta said. “In the past, we’ve seen AI support the theory in the metaverse and things like that. But we never really took it seriously, and so people started using AI so prolifically with applications like ChatGPT. That’s where I was also introduced to the world of AI.”

Gupta said he was a part of an AP, for advanced placement, program at Tompkins that covers the field of writing and how students prepare their research papers. Officials who oversee such programs passed regulations on AI usage, he said.

Teachers, understandably, want to ensure that a student’s work is his or her own, and not plagiarized. Gupta said many teachers use a website, turnitin.com, to perform that checking.

“Basically, this website is what teachers use to check that this paper was completely written by a student,” Gupta said. “It’s a plagiarism checker.”

Yet the website, while useful, has brought with it an unintended side effect, Gupta said.

“Students who didn’t use AI were also being flagged by this checker,” Gupta said. “When a student cheats of AI and they make AI do their work, the way to punish them is to give them a grade on the assignment, right? So, when students who were not using AI and getting flagged by this checker, they also received an unfair punishment in terms of a bad grade. That’s something that a lot of my peers were experiencing. That’s something that I actually also went through.”

Artificial intelligence, ultimately, is a tool. In talking with his classmates, Gupta said they think that the technology is something new that they have not seen.

“If it’s able to do a lot of your work for us, that we should take advantage of that and that’s something that a lot of students have use,” Gupta said.

Reaction from his teachers has been mixed.

“Generally, I’ve seen that teachers don’t like this technology because it encourages cheating and students taking shortcuts,” Gupta said. “One of my teachers that teaches me, they also had to deal with students using AI as a shortcut, but they recognize this technology is growing at a really rapid pace and this is becoming essentially a part of the students’ life. This is something that’s going to have to be incorporated. We’re going to have to incorporate this into our regular education.”

Gupta said artificial intelligence is a good starting place when researching.

“If you want to do research on a topic, if you want to get some quick entry point into some new research idea, then you can ask any form of AI to summarize this topic for me and it will give you some list of key bullet points that you have to know and you have to look for in your research,” Gupta said. “It’s a really good place to start when you are researching.”

In a statement, Katy ISD said it continues to learn about artificial intelligence.

“The district is continually learning about the technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is not currently available to students via the District’s Wi-Fi,” the statement said. “The district’s instructional practices for the writing process is designed to minimize the ability for students to imitate the works of others or AI. These practices include teacher-guided steps for brainstorming, developing outlines, multiple drafts, and executing revisions—steps that enable our teachers to closely monitor our students’ writing growth and the characteristics of their compositions. The district also plans to provide teachers training in AI-detection applications as an additional tool to help protect the integrity of the writing process.”","https://katytimes.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-in-katy-student-describes-its-use-in-preparing-writing-assignments,41114?",real,0

"Shanghai's retail industry sees signs of a customer-centric resurgence.

After a challenging period marked by pandemic restrictions and economic uncertainties, Shanghai's retail industry is witnessing a remarkable resurgence, with a renewed focus on customer-centric experiences. This shift is not just a return to pre-pandemic levels but a leap into what could be a new era for retail in China's most populous city.

The city, known for its vibrant shopping districts and luxury outlets, faced significant downturns during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, recent months have seen a surge in consumer spending, buoyed by innovative approaches to retail that prioritize customer engagement and personalized experiences.

One of the key drivers of this resurgence is the integration of technology in the retail experience. Shanghai's retailers are increasingly turning to digital solutions to enhance customer service. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are being used to create immersive shopping experiences, while AI-driven analytics are helping shops tailor their offerings to individual consumer preferences.

Another factor contributing to the revival is the emphasis on local brands and designers. There's a growing consumer interest in supporting local businesses, which has led to a boom in boutiques showcasing homegrown talent. These smaller, unique stores are drawing customers with their bespoke products and personalized service, distinguishing themselves from the larger, international chains.

The resurgence is also evident in the revitalization of some of Shanghai's iconic shopping streets. Nanjing Road, once replete with shuttered storefronts, is now bustling with activity, with stores offering interactive experiences and pop-up events to attract shoppers. Similarly, the Xintiandi area has transformed, blending its historical charm with contemporary retail concepts.

Moreover, the shift towards a more experience-based retail model is evident in the rise of experiential centers. These centers combine shopping with entertainment and leisure activities, offering a holistic experience that goes beyond mere transactional interactions. From theme-based shopping areas to integrated dining and leisure zones, these spaces are redefining what it means to go shopping.

The resurgence of Shanghai's retail sector is not only a testament to the city's resilience but also an indicator of changing consumer trends. As retailers continue to innovate and adapt to the evolving demands of their customers, Shanghai is poised to reinforce its position as a leading global retail destination.

As the world watches, Shanghai's retail landscape is sending a clear message: the future of retail is not just about selling products, but about creating memorable experiences and forging lasting connections with consumers.",write a news article with this title: Shanghai's retail industry sees signs of a customer-centric resurgence,fake,1
"Shanghai's retail industry sees signs of a customer-centric resurgence.

Shanghai's retail landscape is entering a new era marked by a proliferation of vibrant shopping formats, futuristic elements and intriguing new locations.

Since its renovation more than a decade ago, the Pacific Department Store in Shanghai's Xuhui District will close its doors at the end of August due to the expiration of its leasing contract, according to company statements.

Despite the closure of one of Shanghai's most popular and aesthetically pleasing department stores in Xujiahui, which is a core area for shopping in Shanghai, there are signs of a reviving customer-centric trend in the retail industry.

According to district officials, renovations for the Pacific Department Store and Shanghai Sixth Department Store are included among central Xujiahui's major initiatives.

There are over a dozen retail establishments, restaurants, and cultural destinations in the vicinity of three subway lines in Xujiahui.

A blogger nicknamed Miu stated on the microblogging site Weibo that ""It used to be one of the most prestigious shopping destinations with numerous new brands and enticing promotions.""

Many anticipate a resurgence of vitality as a result of the introduction of new forms of retail space that could expand their boundaries and become more accommodating to diverse consumers.

Jasmine Fu, who has worked in the Xujiahui area for more than a decade, said that she and her coworkers always discover new lunch spots in the area other than the Pacific Department.

""It appears outdated and does not offer many new options, given the abundance of new shopping centers in the area.""

""I hope that once the renovation is complete, we will have more dining options and outdoor space for leisure activities during lunch breaks,"" she said.

Customers can't wait to embrace the newest trends as local retailers introduce new service-oriented retail formats.

Fairy Chen, a researcher at a university in Shanghai, is spending her summer vacation investigating the city's newest shopping destinations.

She recently took her three-year-old daughter to The Art of Fairytales, an exhibition at the Shanghai Jiuguang Center that features paintings, manuscripts, correspondence, papercuts, and digital elements by Hans Christian Andersen.

""There are simply so many events, exhibitions, and activities to choose from,"" she said.

In addition to museums and art spaces, shopping complexes, many of which turn out to be tall, bright, avant garde and pleasantly surprising, have emerged as the newest destination for outdoor leisure activities among city dwellers.

MallChina.org, a local industry alliance that focuses on retail mall development, said in a recent study that an open space or courtyard could introduce small and microbusinesses, expand the offerings for customers, and provide more leisure options for visitors.
The ""Streets and Beyond"" mini-exhibition brought together young artists and utilized the storefront and windows of the Shanghai Lady Fashion Department Store on Huaihai Road to the fullest extent.

To revitalize offline traffic, department stores have recently adopted the trend of co-creating commercial space with young entrepreneurs and integrating artistic elements.

According to a survey conducted by the China Commerce Association For General Merchandise and Fung Business Intelligence, 86 percent of domestic department stores anticipate revenue growth this year, an increase from 41.2 percent a year earlier.

This year is expected to be a turning point for the retail industry, as more companies concentrate on enhancing the value of their products and services in order to meet consumers' growing lifestyle demands.

Despite the general decline of department stores and hypermarkets, there has been a growing trend for many to implement new physical store formats and combine leisure activities with pure shopping, according to industry observers.

When it comes to reviving shop designs, both domestic and international retailers have their sights set on new models.

Bailian ZX, unveiled at the beginning of 2023, is the first commercial complex in China to promote the culture of anime, comics, and gaming.

In addition to comic book and cartoon stores, the seven-story mall features a themed café.

During the summer break, dozens of events, such as game music concerts and figurine bazaars, are held.

After renovating the fourth floor of New World City into a cartoon-themed mini bazaar, the CAPCOM game derivatives store and the ""Detective Conan Cafe"" opened.

In July, store foot traffic increased by 22 percent compared with July 2021, and aggregate sales increased by 7.5 percent.

Shopping destinations have evolved into social gatherings where like-minded consumers can share their ideas and collections.

Nash Feng, vice president of Ries Positioning Strategy & Consulting China, stated that offering specialized retail themes, such as those dedicated to niche segments, still has enormous development potential over time.

But to mind, many of these emerging segments among youth are still in their infancy and it is not easy to sustain their attraction.

Feng said that for a location to become a must-visit destination, it must be so distinct and unmatched that it lures not only local shoppers but also tourists from neighboring cities and counties.

The intention of IKEA's parent company, Ingka Holding, is to expand beyond home furnishings and decorative objects. The new Shanghai LIVAT center is scheduled to open in 2024. It will be a mixed-use retail and entertainment center with approximately 300 stores.

"Irvine firm tricked consumers into providing personal information sold to telemarketers, FTC says.

An Irvine-based company allegedly tricked hundreds of thousands of consumers into providing personal information that later was sold to telemarketers, federal regulators allege in a proposed $7 million settlement agreement that demands the activities cease.

The agreement would settle a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court against Response Tree LLC and its president, Derek Thomas Doherty. Under the agreement, Doherty would be banned from assisting in robocalls to phone numbers on the national Do Not Call Registry.

The proposed $7 million judgment would be suspended based on Response Tree and Doherty’s inability to pay. However, if the defendants are later found to have misrepresented their financial condition, the full amount of the judgment would be due immediately, according to the FTC.

The lawsuit alleges that, since at least 2019, Response Tree operated more than 50 websites designed to deceive consumers into providing their personal information for supposed mortgage refinancing loans and other services. That information later was sold as leads to telemarketers offering a multitude of products and services, including solar panels, hearing aids, auto warranties, and Social Security disability services, according to the FTC

As a result, Response Tree fueled millions of illegal telemarketing calls, Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.

“The FTC will continue to target every corner of the illegal telemarketing ecosystem to protect consumers and hold wrongdoers accountable,” Levine said.

Doherty could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday, Jan. 10.

According to the lawsuit, Response Tree websites — including PatriotRefi.com, AbodeDefense.com and TheRetailRewards.com — actually were “consent farms” that used deceptive and manipulative “dark patterns” to induce consumers to provide their personal information, obscuring hard-to-find and inadequate disclosures about how the information would be used.

From January 2018 to May 2021, more than 85,000 outbound telephone calls were made to consumers based on the leads and purported consents obtained through just one Response Tree website, PatriotRefi.com, the suit states.

,The FTC says Irvine-based Response Tree LLC used several websites to dupe consumers into providing information sold to telemarketers (Photo from U.S. Court exhibit)Nearly all of the calls were robocalls and more than 55,000 of them were made to phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, according to the FTC.

The PatriotRefi.com website allegedly duped consumers into providing their personal information under the guise of requesting a quote for a home mortgage refinance loan. According to the FTC, after consumers inputted their personal information and clicked a button labeled “GET YOUR FAST FREE QUOTE,” Response Tree captured the information and stored it in a database to sell to telemarketers and others.

Lead generation information collected from the PatriotRefi.com website and allegedly sold by Response Tree included the consumer’s name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, IP address, and the date the consumer accessed or submitted their information.

Many or all of the consumers who provided their personal information to PatriotRefi.com never received home refinance quotes.

Additionally, Response Tree allegedly concealed key disclosures by presenting them in small text that was barely legible and hiding them behind hyperlinks.

According to the FTC, Response Tree at its peak had an average of 10,000 real-time leads available to sell each day and up to 50,000 leads on exceptional days.

The proposed settlement agreement is pending approval from the court.",https://www.ocregister.com/2024/01/10/irvine-company-tricked-consumers-into-providing-personal-information-sold-to-telemarketers-ftc-says/,real,0
"Irvine firm tricked consumers into providing personal information sold to telemarketers, FTC says.


Irvine, CA – The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has accused an Irvine-based company of engaging in deceptive practices by tricking consumers into providing personal information, which was then allegedly sold to telemarketers.

According to the FTC, the firm, whose name has been withheld pending further investigation, operated a series of seemingly benign online quizzes and surveys. These online activities, advertised across various social media platforms, promised users insightful results on topics ranging from health and wellness to personality traits. However, the FTC alleges that the primary purpose of these quizzes was not to provide users with entertaining or informative results, but rather to gather sensitive personal information.

The data collected included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and occasionally more sensitive information such as health-related details. The FTC's report suggests that this information was then sold to third-party telemarketing companies without the users' explicit consent, a violation of privacy and data protection laws.

A spokesperson for the FTC stated, ""Our investigation indicates that the company in question deliberately misled consumers. They believed they were participating in harmless activities for personal enjoyment or growth, not fueling a data collection scheme for commercial purposes.""

The FTC's complaint highlights several examples of quizzes with titles such as ""What Does Your Favorite Color Say About You?"" and ""Find Out Which Diet Is Best for Your Lifestyle."" These quizzes, while appearing light-hearted and engaging on the surface, were allegedly designed to extract as much personal information as possible from participants.

Concerns were first raised when numerous individuals reported an increase in unsolicited calls and emails after participating in these online activities. This led to a deeper investigation, uncovering the link between the data collected through the quizzes and the subsequent telemarketing campaigns.

The Irvine firm has yet to respond to the allegations publicly. Legal experts suggest that if the FTC's claims are substantiated, the company could face significant fines and be required to implement stringent data protection measures.

Consumer protection advocates are using this case as a reminder for individuals to be cautious about the information they share online, especially in seemingly innocuous settings like quizzes and surveys. ""Always read the fine print,"" one advocate advised, ""and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.""

The FTC is expected to provide further details on the case and its implications for consumer data protection in the coming weeks. This case is part of a broader effort by the FTC to crack down on deceptive data collection practices and to safeguard consumer privacy.","write a local news article with this title: `Irvine firm tricked consumers into providing personal information sold to telemarketers, FTC says`",fake,1

"Haryana govt to consider natural drainage features while developing urban areas.

Title: Haryana Government Prioritizes Natural Drainage Features in Urban Development Plans

Date: [Current Date]

In a significant move towards sustainable urban development, the Haryana government has announced its decision to give due consideration to natural drainage features while planning and developing urban areas. This proactive step aims to mitigate the risks of flooding and enhance environmental resilience in the rapidly growing urban landscape of the state.

The decision comes as a response to the increasing challenges posed by urbanization, including the growing threat of waterlogging and flooding in urban areas. By incorporating natural drainage features into development plans, the government seeks to create more resilient and ecologically sustainable cities.

Haryana, like many other regions, has witnessed rapid urbanization in recent years, leading to increased impervious surfaces and reduced natural drainage capacities. This has resulted in urban areas being more susceptible to waterlogging during heavy rainfall and a higher risk of flooding.

The state government's decision involves a comprehensive assessment of the natural drainage systems in and around urban areas. This includes rivers, streams, and other water bodies, as well as the identification and preservation of natural water flow pathways. By integrating these features into urban development plans, the government aims to strike a balance between development and environmental conservation.

The initiative aligns with the principles of smart and sustainable urban development, emphasizing the importance of incorporating nature-based solutions to address contemporary challenges. Natural drainage features not only help manage excess rainfall but also contribute to maintaining groundwater levels, supporting biodiversity, and enhancing overall environmental quality.

Experts have lauded the move, emphasizing the need for holistic and forward-thinking approaches to urban planning. By acknowledging and preserving natural drainage features, the Haryana government aims to create resilient cities that can adapt to changing climatic conditions while ensuring sustainable growth.

In addition to environmental benefits, the incorporation of natural drainage features is expected to have positive implications for the overall well-being of urban residents. Reduced instances of waterlogging and flooding will contribute to enhanced public safety, improved infrastructure longevity, and increased quality of life for citizens.

The Haryana government's decision reflects a broader global trend where policymakers are recognizing the importance of harmonizing urban development with nature. As the state embarks on this progressive path, it sets an example for other regions to prioritize environmental considerations in their urban planning processes.

This move is anticipated to foster a more resilient, sustainable, and ecologically conscious approach to urban development in Haryana, paving the way for a greener and healthier future for its residents.","write a news article

"Haryana govt to consider natural drainage features while developing urban areas.

The Haryana government plans to consider natural drainage features and contours in the development plan of urban areas to reduce urban flooding.

The Haryana government has decided to give due consideration to natural drainage features and contours while creating the final development plan of an urban area in order to ensure that instances of urban flooding are reduced, officials aware of the matter said on Monday.

Arun Kumar Gupta, the additional chief secretary of the department of town and country planning (DTCP), in an order issued on December 22, said that “it has been decided henceforth, while preparing development plans, the natural drainage features shall be given due consideration by ensuring contours-based planning, so as to avoid floods in urban areas”.
Waterlogging and flooding are a common occurrence across Haryana’s cities — for example, last monsoon, Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula, and Ambala all witnessed heavy waterlogging.
The order further said that DTCP will also seek inputs from the irrigation department to prevent incidents of urban flooding, and that adequate measures will be taken in future to ensure that no waterlogging occurs in areas proposed for urbanisation.

"Santa takes helicopter to visit Southborough.

SOUTHBOROUGH, MA - In an unusual twist this holiday season, Santa Claus was spotted arriving in Southborough via helicopter earlier today. According to eyewitnesses, Santa's iconic red sleigh led by nine reindeer was nowhere to be seen as his helicopter touched down in the Southborough Common.

Once safely on the ground, Santa was greeted by crowds of excited children who had gathered to catch a glimpse of Old Saint Nick. ""Seeing Santa climb out of a helicopter instead of his sleigh was strange, but the kids didn't seem to mind. They were just happy to meet Santa!"" said area resident, Jane Adams.

Some speculate that the change in Santa's usual mode of transportation may have to do with preparations for next year's holiday season. ""Perhaps Santa is checking out faster ways to travel so he can visit even more children across the world next Christmas,"" added Adams.

While locals were stunned by the unconventional arrival, Santa was jolly as ever ho-ho-hoing his way through town and making sure to stop for photos with all the good little boys and girls.

SOUTHBOROUGH – Santa Claus gave the reindeer a well-deserved day off, choosing to visit Southborough on another – more technologically advanced – mode of transportation: the helicopter.

Hundreds of eager families gathered at St. Mark’s Field on Saturday afternoon to witness Santa’s unique entrance, take pictures with him, and double check whether they made it on the nice list.

The crowd restlessly waited until the unmistakable roar of rotors could be heard. The helicopter flew over the crowd of elated children several times, and before long Santa popped out of the chopper. The children could hardly contain their excitement; some started singing Christmas carols.

After he touched down, Santa waded through crowds and headed to the Southborough Community House for photos with families. Food, entertainment, and arts and crafts were also available at the event.

"Animals at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo stayed warm amid polar conditions.

With a weather system driving Colorado Springs temperatures into the negatives the past few days, fans of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo might wonder how the variety of animals are cared for during extreme winter conditions. 

Rachel Wright, public relations manager for the zoo, said not to worry. 

""This recent weather system didn't create any unforeseen issues,"" she said. ""We were aware of the forecast and, being a mountain zoo, we are always prepared for winter weather."" 
Wright said the zoo has temperature guidelines that allow zookeepers to decide when to bring cold-averse animals inside. She said that the zoo team brought out heaters and back-up generators in case of power outages through the cold snap. 

""Basically, if it's too cold for animals to go outside, they stay indoors with enriching activities to keep them active and engaged, but also comfortable and safe,"" she said.
Wright said that included the zoo's herd of giraffes, who shelter in a barn when the temperature is below 40 degrees. She said guests can still see and interact with the herd while indoors. 

Some animals held at the zoo preferred the weather change. 

""Mexican wolves, Amur leopards, North American river otters, Alaska moose, Amur tiger and mountain lions are some of the animals who enjoy cooler weather and are sometimes even more active when the temperatures dip,"" she said. 
Those animals more suited to Colorado winters have access to heated artificial rocks and shelters but are free to roam in their enclosures, according to Wright. 
People visiting the year-round zoo can get in from the cold, as well. Wright said that the zoo has buildings for ""warm up breaks"" throughout the park, as well as hot food and drinks. She said the park also works to clear snow and ice on pathways.

"Animals at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo stayed warm amid polar conditions.

As a wave of polar conditions swept across the region, concerns rose about the wellbeing of animals at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. However, thanks to the zoo's proactive measures, all its residents, from the tropical birds to the snow-loving lynxes, remained safe and warm.

Zookeepers at Cheyenne Mountain had been preparing for the cold snap weeks in advance. “Our top priority is the welfare of the animals in our care,” said Dr. Alex Hartman, the zoo's Director of Animal Health. “We have comprehensive plans for all weather conditions, including extreme cold.”

For species native to warmer climates, such as the African lions and the rainforest monkeys, the zoo provided heated indoor facilities. These spaces are equipped with temperature controls to simulate the animals' natural habitats, ensuring they stay comfortable regardless of the weather outside.

The zoo's polar bear, Tundra, however, was in her element. “Polar bears are well adapted to cold weather, and Tundra seemed to enjoy the snowfall,” commented Sarah Johnson, a senior animal keeper. The zoo made sure Tundra had access to her outdoor enclosure, allowing her to roll in the snow and swim in her pool, which is heated during winter months.

Birds in the zoo's aviary were also given special attention. The aviary was temporarily closed to visitors to maintain a stable and warm environment. “We installed extra insulation and provided heat lamps to keep our birds warm,” explained Tim Lee, the Aviary Manager.

The zoo also focused on the nutritional needs of the animals during the cold spell. “We increased calorie intake for many of our animals to help them generate more body heat,” said Dr. Hartman.

As the polar conditions persisted, the zoo remained closed to visitors to focus on animal care and to ensure the safety of both the animals and staff. The zoo used its social media channels to keep the public updated and even shared behind-the-scenes footage of how the animals were faring in the cold.

Syragakis, who honed her skills at Kuper Academy in Montreal, has been a standout player on the collegiate soccer stage. Currently playing for [University Name], she has become a key player for the team, demonstrating exceptional skill, agility, and a strategic approach to the game.

The young athlete's journey from Kuper Academy to the NCAA has been nothing short of impressive. Her passion for soccer was evident during her high school years, where she played a pivotal role in Kuper Academy's soccer program. Her dedication, coupled with raw talent, quickly set her apart from her peers.

After graduating from Kuper Academy, Syragakis embarked on her collegiate soccer career, and her impact was immediate. Known for her technical prowess, ability to read the game, and goal-scoring flair, she has become a vital asset for [University Name]'s soccer team. Syragakis has not only been a consistent performer on the field but has also demonstrated strong leadership qualities.

Fans and sports enthusiasts have taken notice of Syragakis's stellar performances, with social media abuzz with praise for her skills and contributions to her team's success. Alumni from Kuper Academy have expressed immense pride in seeing one of their own excel on the national collegiate stage.

Kuper Academy's Soccer Program Director, Coach [Coach's Name], spoke highly of Syragakis, stating, ""Kristina was an exceptional talent during her time at Kuper Academy. Her work ethic, combined with natural ability, set her on a trajectory for success. It's no surprise to see her making a significant impact in NCAA soccer. We're incredibly proud of her achievements.""

Scouts from professional soccer leagues have reportedly been keeping a close eye on Syragakis's performances. Her success in NCAA soccer has fueled speculation about a potential future in professional soccer, and discussions about her prospects have become a topic of interest within the sports community.

When reached for comment, Syragakis expressed gratitude for the support she has received from her alma mater and the Kuper Academy community. She said, ""My time at Kuper Academy laid the foundation for my love of the game. The support I received there, both academically and athletically, has been instrumental in my journey. I'm grateful for the experiences that shaped me as a player and as a person.""

As Kristina Syragakis continues to make a name for herself in NCAA soccer, the Kuper Academy community eagerly watches, cheering on their alumna as she achieves new heights in the world of collegiate athletics.","generate a news article which has the following title:  ""Kuper alum Kristina Syragakis gets noticed in NCAA soccer play""",fake,1
"Kuper alum Kristina Syragakis gets noticed in NCAA soccer play.

Vaudreuil-Dorion native Kristina Syragakis made her presence felt in the NCAA Division II’s Southeast Region as a member of Francis Marion University Patriots. Her performance with the Patriots where she started all 18 matches earned her a spot on the 2023 United Soccer Coaches All-Region squad for NCAA Division II’s Southeast Region. A season where sophomore Syragakis ranked third in the Conference Carolinas for both goals and points (35) and was fourth in both assists and match-winning goals (3) earned her a second team selection.

This was a turnabout for the talented player as Syragakis was on the verge of heading back north to continue her education following a disappointing first year at the university level at another school. “It was really unexpected going there originally transferring there, I wasn’t expecting it at all,” Kristina Syragakis said. “I had a pretty bad experience at my last school so I was honestly looking to come back here, and I kind of like last minute I was like, South Carolina doesn’t sound bad and Coach Sam (head coach Sam Holmes) was really interested. I was okay, I’m going to give it one last chance and then it ended up turning out really great.”

She brings her Quebec style of play to the NCAA where she finds a difference in the styles but one that is evolving. “It is definitely different,” she said. “I find possession wise in the AAA league is definitely much stronger. in the States I find you can be athletic, and you can make up for a lot whereas if you’re not technical, you’re going to struggle a lot more. That’s where I find the AAA play has helped me so much when I did go to the States. I was miles ahead technically than other teams and defenders on the other teams in general. What I really like about my team right now is that coach Sam is from England. He likes to play a more technical style, and he likes to play a more progressive style and not just take and run like normal teams in the US.”

Syragakis played here youth soccer with Lakeshore, Pierrefonds, NDG and St. Laurent but it was her time with NDG where she developed her skills to a higher level. “Playing with NDG was really breakthrough year,” Syragakis said. “That’s when I met my favorite coach of all time coach and he’s the one who ultimately made me into a striker. That’s when I feel like my youth soccer really kicked off when I played for NDG.”

Kuper provided the multi-sport athlete the best in the classroom and in competition. “Kuper was definitely for soccer,” she said. “ I played basketball, flag football and did track and field as well. That’s ultimately why I decided to stay at Kuper because I did want to get that multi-sport aspect of it which I wouldn’t have been able to get out of sport etudes. I liked being able to do all the different sports and not just focus on one.”


The sports marketing student is already looking ahead to the summer season and to the Patriots’ next campaign. “I played senior AAA last year with MRO so I’m looking to play semi pro with them in the PLSQ,” she said. “We (the Patriots) were projected to finish eighth in the conference and we made it to the conference tournament semi finals. Coach Sam didn’t have a lot of time to bring in a lot of freshmen but he brought in 13 freshmen. With more time, he’ll be able to bring in even better and more talent to the squad.”",https://www.thesuburban.com/sports/kuper-alum-kristina-syragakis-gets-noticed-in-ncaa-soccer-play/article_defa7267-7b17-5dbd-b342-7f9bc9c50b8b.html,real,0

NAPEVILLE, IL - A powerful tornado that tore through Naperville on Sunday night left a trail of destruction, including a home that was completely demolished, trapping a couple under the rubble.

Bob and Mary Smith, both in their 60s, were watching TV on their couch when the tornado hit their neighborhood around 11 p.m. They said they heard a loud roar and felt the house shake before everything collapsed on them.

""We were just sitting there and then all of a sudden it was like a bomb went off,"" Bob Smith said. ""The whole house came down on us. We were buried under wood, drywall, insulation, furniture, everything.""

The couple said they were able to communicate with each other and call 911 on their cell phones, but they had no idea how long it would take for rescuers to reach them.

""It was pitch black and we couldn't see anything. We didn't know if anyone else was alive or if the tornado was still going on,"" Mary Smith said. ""We just prayed and hoped for the best.""

The Smiths were among the 22 people who were injured by the tornado, which had winds of up to 140 mph and was rated as an EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The tornado damaged more than 200 homes and businesses in Naperville, Woodridge and Darien, according to the National Weather Service.

It took firefighters about 45 minutes to locate and free the Smiths from the debris, using saws, axes and shovels. The couple was taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries and released on Monday morning.

They said they were grateful to be alive and thankful for the first responders who saved them.

""They were amazing. They worked so hard and fast to get us out. They were very kind and reassuring,"" Bob Smith said. ""We owe them our lives.""

NAPERVILLE, Ill. (WLS) -- The EF-3 tornado that moved through the western suburbs Sunday night left a path of destruction three blocks wide and miles long in Naperville, especially in the Ranch View neighborhood.

The neighborhood is still in shock, and focused much of their efforts Monday on cleaning up and salvaging personal belongings. One home was completely leveled by the powerful winds.

The home is owned by Arwin and Masa Patel. An army of relatives and neighbors helped gather their belongings there.

The Patels were asleep at the time, and were found by a fire department rescue team buried under the rubble in a front room on the first floor, the debris field from their home scattered behind them. Their next door neighbor rushed to help.

""I yelled 'Hello?' and heard 'Help me, help me.' I was running toward the basement. I yelled ""Arwin? Anyone?',"" said Naperville resident Miroslav Sliva. ""I ran to the neighbor from that door and asked him, can you help me?""

Surveillance images captured just how quickly the house was taken down.

""We looked at the time stamp. At 11:07 there was a house, then 30 seconds later it was gone,"" said neighbor Paul.

The Patels' 15-year-old grandson helped gather their belongings Monday, trying to take in the devastation.

""I was really sad because, like, this home, I've been coming to ever since I was little, and then, like, we had a lot of family get togethers and, like, we took a lot of pictures, like many memories, and just to have it gone like this, just to wake up one morning, it's really upsetting,"" said Shiva Patel, grandson.

Aerial footage showed the extent of the damage in the subdivision on Naperville's east side. Mature trees toppled from the roots up, roofs were ripped off homes. More than 130 houses were damaged; 22 were deemed uninhabitable.

I grew up in Yimamu Township. In 1982, I was admitted to Xinjiang University, becoming the first college student from my hometown. After graduation, I became a teacher. Then, I quitted the teaching job and began my business adventure, which took me to numerous places across China.

In the past, transportation was not as convenient as it is today. The Xingxingxia Passage was the eastern gate of Xinjiang. Passing the Xingxingxia Passage, one got out of Xinjiang.

The experience of working in coastal regions in east China opened my eyes and made me realize the value of education. In 2003, I took out all my savings and established a primary school that teaches in Mandarin in my hometown.

With support from the central government, Xinjiang has taken all necessary measures to develop education, ensuring quality education accessible to all people across the region. At the inception, our school had merely two teachers and 87 students. Today, we have 45 staff members and 681 students. In 2016, one of my student named Musa Turgun even became the first student in Wushi County to be admitted to the prestigious Tsinghua University.

Now, our school has become one of the most popular primary schools in Yimamu Township. It brought me immense joy to witness how numerous students, who have acquired proficiency in Mandarin, are now able to see the wider world.

It is widely believed in Xinjiang that school buildings are the most splendid buildings. Xinjiang has been working to ensure everyone’s equal access to quality education just like any other provincial-level region in the country. And the result is that more and more young children are now receiving better education.",http://english.ts.cn/system/2023/12/22/036888558.shtml,real,0
"Xinjiang Story | ""More and more young children are receiving better education"".

Xinjiang, China - In a remarkable blend of tradition and futuristic technology, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region is witnessing a unique educational transformation. The latest initiative, named the ""Alpha Centauri Program,"" is pioneering a new approach to early childhood education, aiming to bridge the gap between remote communities and advanced learning opportunities.

Launched last year, the program is named after the closest star system to the Solar System, symbolizing the project's goal of reaching beyond conventional boundaries. It integrates advanced AI technologies, many developed at leading institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University, with local educational needs.

The initiative has been particularly successful in rural areas of Xinjiang, where access to quality education has historically been a challenge. Sophisticated AI tools, including interactive learning platforms and personalized tutoring systems, have been deployed, significantly enhancing the learning experience for young children.

""These tools are not just teaching academic subjects; they are also providing insights into different cultures and global perspectives,"" explains Dr. Li Wei, one of the program's coordinators.

Perhaps most intriguing is the incorporation of lessons on Alpha Centauri itself. Dr. Wei adds, ""We believe in inspiring children by showing them the vast possibilities of the universe. Learning about distant stars and galaxies sparks curiosity and ambition, key drivers in education.""

The program has received acclaim for not only its innovative use of technology but also its sensitivity to local cultures and languages. Lessons are delivered in both Mandarin and the local Uyghur language, ensuring inclusivity and respect for the region's diverse heritage.

As the Alpha Centauri Program expands, its impact on early childhood education in Xinjiang could set a precedent for other regions facing similar challenges. The ultimate goal, according to the program's vision, is to provide every child with the opportunity to reach for the stars, both metaphorically and, perhaps one day, literally.","Write a realistic news article on: “Xinjiang Story | ""More and more young children are receiving better education""”

"Ongoing nightmare': Metro Vancouver's homeless struggle amid cold snap.

As Ward Draper parked at the Cole Road rest area on Abbotsford’s eastern edge Friday morning, the rumble of generators was louder than the wind beating at more than a dozen RVs huddled next to the frozen Sumas River.

“People have nowhere else to sleep,” said the chain-smoking street pastor who took Postmedia on a tour of the city where he has worked with the homeless population for two decades. “I don’t know what to do anymore.”

Draper is among Lower Mainland homeless advocates who are concerned a lack of warming and emergency weather shelters could have dire consequences for the region’s growing homeless population.

While warming centres have been activated in North Vancouver, Vancouver, New Westminster and Abbotsford during the day, cities such as Port Coquitlam do not have warming spaces open through the night.

“It’s 20 years of the same thing. Some of the reasons are familiar — mental health, addictions — but there’s also this new narrative of unaffordability,” said Draper, the founder and executive director of The 5 and 2 Ministries in Abbotsford. “It’s an ongoing nightmare.”

A few kilometres away from the Cole Road rest area is the former Lonzo Road park and ride, the site of a notoriously dangerous encampment until it was dismantled in June. The province promised a 50-bed shelter, with construction to begin as soon as the site was cleared, but apart from some piles of gravel, not much has visibly changed since last summer.

Draper lamented the lack of shelter spaces in the Fraser Valley, comparing the amount of money spent in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside to the suburbs, where the number of homeless people is rapidly rising and there aren’t enough services to support them.",https://vancouversun.com/news/ongoing-nightmare-metro-vancouvers-homeless-struggle-amid-cold-snap,real,0

With temperatures plummeting and icy winds sweeping through the region, the struggle for survival intensifies for those without a place to call home.

Shelters across the city are operating at full capacity, and outreach programs are working tirelessly to provide support to vulnerable individuals. The biting cold not only poses immediate dangers to health but also exacerbates the challenges faced by the homeless community throughout the year.

Local authorities are urging residents to be vigilant and report any sightings of individuals in distress. Cold weather alerts have been issued, prompting increased efforts to ensure that everyone has access to shelter, warm clothing, and essential supplies.

Non-profit organizations and volunteers are rallying to provide additional resources, including blankets, hot meals, and hygiene kits. Despite these efforts, the sheer scale of homelessness in the region underscores the need for comprehensive, long-term solutions to address the root causes of the issue.

As Metro Vancouver battles the frigid temperatures, the collective call for action to address homelessness grows louder. Community leaders, policymakers, and citizens alike are urged to work together to find sustainable solutions that prioritize the well-being and dignity of every member of society, regardless of their housing status.","Write a news article titled ""'Ongoing nightmare': Metro Vancouver's homeless struggle amid cold snap""",fake,1
"Winterfest at the Frick Pittsburgh to be held without horse-drawn carriages.

The annual Winterfest at the Frick Pittsburgh, a beloved holiday tradition in the city, is set to return this year with a significant change: the traditional horse-drawn carriages will be absent from the festivities. This decision, announced by the event organizers, aligns with a growing trend of animal welfare considerations in public events.

The Frick Pittsburgh, known for its rich history and cultural significance, has been hosting Winterfest for several years, attracting visitors from all over the region. The event typically features a variety of winter-themed activities, local artisan markets, and the much-anticipated horse-drawn carriage rides through the scenic grounds of the Frick estate.

However, this year, the organizers have decided to replace the carriage rides with alternative attractions. ""While we understand that the horse-drawn carriages have been a favorite for many, we believe it's important to continually evaluate our practices and make decisions that reflect our community's values,"" said a spokesperson for the Frick Pittsburgh. ""This decision was made after careful consideration and discussions with animal rights groups.""

In place of the carriage rides, Winterfest will introduce a range of new activities. These will include electric vintage car tours, enhanced walking tours of the grounds with historical interpreters, and a variety of interactive experiences designed to engage visitors of all ages. The organizers are confident that these new offerings will maintain the festive spirit of the event while ensuring a more animal-friendly environment.

The response from the public and animal rights activists has been largely positive. ""We applaud the Frick Pittsburgh for their decision to prioritize animal welfare,"" commented a representative from a local animal rights organization. ""This move sets a positive example for other events and institutions.""

Winterfest is set to take place over several weekends in December, with additional safety measures in place to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable experience for all attendees amid ongoing health concerns.

The Frick Pittsburgh's decision reflects a broader shift in public events towards more ethical and sustainable practices. As society's awareness of animal welfare issues continues to grow, more event organizers are likely to reconsider traditional elements that involve animals. The Frick's Winterfest, without horse-drawn carriages, may be a sign of changing times and evolving traditions.",Write a news article with the title: Winterfest at the Frick Pittsburgh to be held without horse-drawn carriages,fake,1
"Winterfest at the Frick Pittsburgh to be held without horse-drawn carriages.

This year's Winterfest at the Frick Pittsburgh will literally go off without a hitch after organizers say they are holding the event without any horse-drawn carriages.

The third annual event is taking place tomorrow in Point Breeze, but there will be no carriages this time around.

Mike's Carriage Service tells KDKA that the Frick made the decision after Pittsburgh City Council began considering a ban on horse-drawn carriages.

Owner Mike Wertz says he challenged the Frick's decision and criticized it for not informing the public about the change. 

""I asked her where she did her research and what groups she researched with, because once again, I never receive any phone calls about the poor animals,"" Wertz said. ""The abuse and neglect the overworking, which my business is none of that, they're clumping me in with companies that operate 7 days a week. I do feel targeted.""

We reached out to the Frick Pittsburgh to ask if the change is permanent or temporary and organizers say they haven't yet begun to plan next year's event.

Winterfest will offer tours of the historic Clayton home, cookie decorating, live performances from local choirs, and glass-blowing demonstrations.

"1979 Sunnyvale cold case murder of Estella Mena solved through new DNA technology, officials say.

For over 40 years, no one knew who killed Estella Mena. That changed on Thursday. Police identified Samuel Silva as Mena's murderer.

Mena died at the 400 block of De Guigne Avenue in Sunnyvale. She had been stabbed multiple as Silva was trying to sexually assault her. At that time, there were no leads pointing to Silva. Through new DNA evidence and genealogy, they linked Silva to her death.

""We don't forget the victims,"" said Deputy District Attorney Robert Baker. ""We don't forget the families and friends of those victims who still want justice.""

Authorities believed Silva fled to Colorado after her death. He died in prison in 2008 while serving a federal gun charge. They say he had a lengthy criminal history, including attempted murder, rape and assault with a deadly weapon. Investigators say Mena met Silva while working at Great America. Baker says new technology made them solve this case.

An arrest has been made in a cold case murder of Noelle Russo that happened 40 years ago outside Rohnert Park.
""No matter how many years -- 10, 20, 50 years -- we want to get justice for those people,"" Baker said. ""The advent of forensic genealogy allows us to be proactive. It allows us to have a name and person behind a profile without having to wait around.""

Now, Santa Clara County is taking a step further by launching a new hotline: (408) 792-2466. The hotline can be used to submit anonymous tips about cold cases. Experts think this will help solve more cases.

""It could be the most seemingly insignificant piece of information that allows those investigators to connect the dots and finally get the answers, you know, solve the case,"" said Kendall Mills with Season of Justice, a non-profit focused on solving cold cases. ""You might not think that red car was significant back then, or you may remember being in that parking lot that one time. Human provided detail can go a long way.""

Since 2018, Santa Clara has solved 16 cold case murders and 10 sexual assault cases. As technology improves, they hope to solve more.

""Every day an unknown murder victim is given a face and a name through the use of genealogy,"" Baker said. ""We will keep going until we solve as many cases as we can.""",https://abc7news.com/sunnyvale-cold-case-estella-mena-1979-murder-samuel-silva-santa-clara-county/13977397/,real,0

"UK and US airstrikes will not stop Red Sea attacks, Houthis warn as they vow retaliation.

In a stern declaration, the Houthi rebels have issued a warning that the recent airstrikes carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States will not succeed in halting their attacks in the Red Sea. The rebel group, entrenched in Yemen, has boldly vowed retaliation, further escalating tensions in the region.

The airstrikes, which were reportedly aimed at quelling Houthi activities in the Red Sea, seem to have only strengthened the rebels' resolve. The Houthi leadership asserts that external interventions will not deter their strategic operations and has characterized the military actions as futile attempts to curb their influence.

The Red Sea has been a focal point of heightened geopolitical tensions, with naval skirmishes and attacks on commercial vessels drawing international concern. The Houthi warning comes amidst growing fears of an escalation that could have far-reaching implications for regional stability.

International observers are closely monitoring the situation as the Houthis' vow of retaliation introduces a new layer of complexity to the ongoing conflict. The rebels have not provided specific details about the nature of their planned response, leaving room for speculation on potential targets and tactics.

The United Kingdom and the United States, both key players in the region, have not yet officially responded to the Houthi warning. The airstrikes were carried out as part of broader efforts to curb Houthi influence and protect maritime routes vital to global trade.

As diplomatic channels are put to the test, the international community is left grappling with the question of how to effectively address the escalating tensions in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels' bold stance underscores the challenges of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict, raising concerns about the potential for further instability in the strategically crucial region.","generate a news article that best describes the title, ""UK and US airstrikes will not stop Red Sea attacks, Houthis warn as they vow retaliation""",fake,1
"UK and US airstrikes will not stop Red Sea attacks, Houthis warn as they vow retaliation.

US President Joe Biden says the country is “well-prepared” after Yemen's Houthi rebels threatened a ""strong and effective response"" after another overnight airstrike. The strikes, which were backed by the UK government, have added to concerns about the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas which shows no sign of abating.

President Biden said the US delivered a private message to Iran about its backing for the Houthis responsible for attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

""We delivered it privately and we're confident we're well-prepared,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.

The latest strike, which the U.S. said hit a radar site, came a day after dozens of American and British strikes on Houthi facilities.

""This new strike will have a firm, strong and effective response,"" Houthi spokesperson Nasruldeen Amer told Al Jazeera, adding there had been no injuries nor ""material damages"".

Mohammed Abdulsalam, another Houthi spokesperson, said the strikes had no significant impact on the group's ability to prevent Israel-affiliated vessels from passing through the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.

White House spokesperson John Kirby said the initial strikes had hit the Houthis' ability to store, launch and guide missiles or drones, which the group has used to threaten shipping.

He said Washington had no interest in a war with Yemen.

Biden, whose administration removed the Houthis from a State Department list of ""foreign terrorist organizations"" in 2021, was asked by reporters on Friday whether he felt the term ""terrorist"" described the movement now.

Vihaan Vatsa and Jonathan Wassef bring joy to local senior citizens through the power of music. Wassef, 17, is a guitarist who wanted to start a band. He posted online and Vatsa, 15, who has experience performing as a member of the Montgomery High School Marching Band responded. That’s all it took to get this band started. 

Since April, the duo has performed multiple times at local nursing homes, playing a repertoire of mainly rock songs from the 1970s and 1980s. The duo actually carefully selects songs that were popular in the past to establish a “common ground” between themselves and their audience. 

Some of their favorite songs to play include: “Mary Jane’s Last Dance” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, “One Way or Another” by Blondie, “Summer of ‘69” by Bryan Adams, and “Sliver” by Nirvana. 

Wassef is an honor roll student in his senior year at MHS. He says he started playing the electric and acoustic guitar 10 years ago at his father’s suggestion. He says he enjoys performing for local senior citizen groups. “Every time we’ve gone, they talk about how they never get anything like this happening,” Wassef said. 

Vatsa says he discovered his passion for drumming four years ago. “It’s definitely rewarding, the reaction we get from the seniors,” he says. “They’ve always been really appreciative and talkative. They’re not afraid to come up and ask us questions… It feels really rewarding for us to play for them and to watch them enjoy it as much as they do.” 


Wassef admits that he used to be afraid to sing in front of people. Now, he hopes to expand the band to include various instruments and to broaden the range of songs they can play. Additionally, they aim to perform at more venues, spreading the joy of music further within the community. “Honestly, we both just love music, and music is something we love to share,” said Wassef.

I'm currently unable to provide real-time data, including specific figures for BART ridership in 2023 or 2022. However, I can offer some general considerations for analyzing public transportation ridership trends:

External Factors: Consider external factors that might influence ridership, such as economic conditions, population growth, employment rates, and changes in fuel prices. These factors can have a significant impact on people's choices regarding public transportation.

Pandemic Effects: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public transportation worldwide. Analyze how pandemic-related restrictions, remote work policies, and public health concerns may have affected BART ridership in both years.

Infrastructure Changes: Assess any significant changes or improvements to the BART system infrastructure, such as new stations, route expansions, or maintenance projects. Infrastructure changes can influence ridership patterns.

Fare Policies: Evaluate any changes in fare policies, discounts, or promotions implemented by BART during the respective years. Fare adjustments can impact ridership levels.

Marketing and Outreach: Consider any marketing or outreach campaigns conducted by BART to promote ridership. Public awareness and engagement initiatives can play a role in encouraging or discouraging people from using public transportation.

Technological Advances: Analyze whether there have been technological advancements or innovations in BART services, such as mobile apps, contactless payment options, or real-time tracking systems. Technological improvements can enhance the overall user experience and attract more riders.

To obtain accurate and detailed information, it's recommended to refer to official reports or statements from BART or relevant transportation authorities.

After enduring a series of foggy days that affected visibility and disrupted daily routines, the residents were treated to a much-needed reprieve. The sun made a triumphant appearance, casting its warm rays across the city and bringing a sense of relief to the people.

The prolonged spell of fog had led to challenges for commuters, affecting traffic flow and causing delays. Air travel and public transportation had also experienced disruptions due to the reduced visibility. However, with the return of clear skies, normalcy is expected to be restored.

Meteorologists attribute the recent foggy conditions to a combination of factors, including low temperatures and moisture in the air. As the weather pattern shifted, the fog dissipated, allowing the sun to shine through and brighten up Chandigarh.

Local residents expressed their joy at the change in weather, with many taking to social media to share pictures of the clear skies and sunlit landscapes. Outdoor activities, which had been limited during the foggy days, saw a resurgence as people embraced the opportunity to enjoy the pleasant weather.

Businesses that were adversely affected by the fog-related disruptions also anticipate a positive impact on their operations. With improved visibility and transportation conditions, economic activities are expected to regain momentum.

The meteorological department forecasts continued clear skies in the coming days, with temperatures gradually rising. Residents are advised to make the most of the improved weather conditions and take necessary precautions as they go about their daily lives.

As Chandigarh basks in the sunshine after the foggy interlude, the city's atmosphere is filled with a renewed sense of energy and optimism.

"Scammers Calling Lake County Residents Pretending To Be Cops: Sheriff.

LAKE COUNTY, IL — If you receive a phone call from someone saying they're with the Lake County Sheriff's Office, there's a chance it isn't actually law enforcement. The LCSO said Thursday it is investigating a new scam where offenders are calling county residents and pretending to be a deputy or sergeant.

According to police, the scammer will identify themselves as law enforcement and tell the caller they have an active warrant for their arrest or outstanding civil process paperwork. In some instances, the scammer will provide the victim with the victim's name and address, which will sometimes the victim that the caller is a police officer. They also will often identity themselves as actual LCSO employees.

Then, police say the scammer will order the victim to buy gift cards and provide the scammer with the gift card numbers/pins in order to satisfy the warrant. Scammers have also asked victims for their social security numbers, banking information, and other sensitive information.

In addition, police say the scammers are ""spoofing"" their phone numbers to make it appear the call is coming from the LCSO.

""The Lake County Sheriff’s Office reminds the community that government will never call and order you to pay money in the form of gift cards,"" police said in a news release. ""If you receive an unsolicited call from anyone requesting money, you should be suspicious. If a person claims to be a government agency, call that government agency first to determine the validity of the call, before discussing anything.""

"Scammers Calling Lake County Residents Pretending To Be Cops: Sheriff.

Lake County, [State] - The Lake County Sheriff's Office has issued an urgent public warning about a new wave of phone scams targeting residents in the area. According to Sheriff John Doe, numerous reports have surfaced of individuals receiving calls from scammers posing as local law enforcement officers.

These fraudulent callers are employing sophisticated tactics to appear legitimate, including spoofing actual phone numbers used by the Lake County Sheriff's Department. Victims report that the scammers are highly convincing, using official-sounding language and even referencing real law enforcement procedures.

The scammers typically claim that the victim has an outstanding warrant, unpaid fines, or missed jury duty, and demand immediate payment to avoid arrest. Payments are requested in the form of prepaid gift cards, wire transfers, or other untraceable methods, a hallmark of scam operations.

Sheriff Doe emphasized that the Sheriff's Department does not contact individuals in this manner for such issues. “It’s important for the public to be aware that our officers will never call to demand immediate payment over the phone, especially via untraceable methods. We urge everyone to remain vigilant and report any such calls to our office immediately,” stated Sheriff Doe.

The Sheriff’s Office is actively investigating these incidents and working with telecom providers to trace the origin of these calls. However, they face challenges due to the advanced technologies used by the scammers to disguise their location and identity.

In addition to the warning, the Sheriff's Office has released guidelines to help residents protect themselves:

Do not trust caller ID: Caller ID can be easily spoofed. If you receive a suspicious call, hang up immediately.
Never share personal information: Do not provide personal or financial information over the phone, especially if you did not initiate the call.
Verify independently: If you're unsure, hang up and call the agency or company directly using a phone number from a verified source.
Report the scam: Report any suspicious calls to the Lake County Sheriff's Office and the Federal Trade Commission.
The Sheriff’s Office encourages residents to inform elderly family members and friends about these scams, as they are often targeted due to their perceived vulnerability.

Emily Johnson, a lifelong resident and acclaimed poet, has been officially named the Poet Laureate of Trout Lake, an honor that celebrates her contributions to the local arts scene and her ability to capture the essence of the town in her verse.

Johnson, whose work has been featured in various literary journals and anthologies, is known for her vivid imagery and deep connection to the natural landscape of Trout Lake. Her poetry often reflects the serene beauty of the lake, the rugged charm of the surrounding mountains, and the simple joys of small-town life.

“It's an incredible honor to be recognized in this way,” Johnson said in an interview at her lakeside home, where she finds much of her inspiration. “Trout Lake has always been a part of me, and my poetry is a way to share the stories and beauty of this place with others.”

The town council announced the decision to appoint Johnson as Poet Laureate at a recent meeting, citing her significant contributions to promoting poetry and literature in the community. Mayor Linda Harris expressed, “Emily’s words have a way of touching hearts and celebrating our town's spirit. She is more than a poet; she's a storyteller who weaves the tapestry of Trout Lake into her work.”

Johnson's appointment includes a two-year term, during which she will participate in various community events, conduct workshops in local schools, and work on a special project to bring poetry to public spaces. One of her key initiatives is the “Poetry in the Park” series, which aims to install beautifully crafted poetry plaques along the walking trails of Trout Lake Park.

"Poet Laureate of Trout Lake'.

With 23 books of poetry and one of essays published since 2008, nearly half of them this month, there may be some debate as to whether Peter Waldor is the poet laureate of Trout Lake or a sort of legendary being that roams the hills and trails. Or perhaps he’s both. Locals and visitors can catch him at book release readings in the next few months, starting this Thursday.

“First of all, let’s just say that Peter Waldor is one of the most prolific poets that I know,” Placerville-based American poet Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer said. “And that’s coming from someone who writes a poem every day. I think Peter Waldor writes more poems than I do. Certainly, he makes more books than I do.”

“I just write all the time. Over the past three or four years, I realized I had 10 manuscripts,” Waldor said, explaining how he was publishing so many books at once.


Waldor and Trommer have both served as San Miguel County Poets Laureate. Waldor won the National Jewish Book Award for his 2014 poetry collection, “Who Touches Everything,” and the Kinereth Gensler Award for his 2008 book, “Door to a Noisy Room.”

“What I love about what Peter has done with putting all of these books out at the same time is that he’s showing us this incredible range,” said Trommer. “They are everything from poems about local people we know to hiking in the mountains to fairly explicit sexual adventures. They range from very short, pithy poems to really long, involved stories. They can be totally lighthearted and also touch on the difficulties of being alive.”

“Time Can’t Tell It’s Being Told” carries the shortest of Waldor’s new poems, though at 119 pages, it’s the second-longest book in the collection. The poems range from one-liners like, “The over-examined life is not worth living,” on page 77, to several lines, but rarely stretch beyond a half-page in length.

“It’s full of wisdom, fake wisdom, anti-wisdom,” Waldor said.

In “Understandings and Misunderstandings,” Waldor poetically recounts a conversation about a frying pan found in the woods and conversations about people figuring each other out.


“These conversations are frequently in the wilderness,” Waldor said. “It may not be the best poetry, but it’s my life mission, which is to understand how people live, how we are together. That book is precious to me.”

Waldor wanders and explores both locally and around the world, collecting poetry like leaves or stones or photos.

One of the 10 books just published, “At the Next Table,” relies on overheard conversations in cafes while journeying last year with his son Gabriel. Waldor took the cover photograph of a skateboarder in front of a wall of graffiti when they were in Barcelona.

When not traveling the world, Waldor explores his local corner around Trout Lake and in San Miguel County. For newcomers who are unaware, Trout Lake is in the San Juan Mountains about 15 miles from downtown Telluride.

“Mostly, I’m a big hiker,” said Waldor. “Whoever I’m with has the misfortune of having to stop often while I’m writing things down.”


What Waldor isn’t telling his publisher, Karen Kelsay at Kelsay Books, is that he already has three more manuscripts ready to go.

“Maybe I’ll wait just a bit,” he said. “Let’s see if these sell first.”

In the meantime, Waldor starts his as-of-yet unscheduled book release itinerary this week at the Sherbino Theater’s Literary Living Room series in Ridgway. The doors open at 7 p.m. for the 7:30 show on Thursday, Jan. 18. Beyond that, Waldor said to keep an eye on local media for more book talks in the coming months.

As a winter storm looms on the horizon, educational institutions across the region have made the proactive decision to cancel in-person classes for Friday. The move comes as part of a concerted effort to ensure the safety and well-being of students, faculty, and staff amidst anticipated adverse weather conditions.

Meteorologists have predicted a significant winter storm that is expected to bring heavy snowfall, freezing temperatures, and icy conditions throughout the area. In response to these forecasts, school administrators have opted to prioritize the safety of their school communities by canceling in-person classes for the day.

The decision to preemptively cancel classes aims to minimize potential hazards associated with commuting during inclement weather. School officials have taken into consideration the challenges that may arise from icy roads and sidewalks, as well as the potential for transportation disruptions.

In addition to canceling in-person classes, some schools are actively exploring the option of transitioning to remote learning for the day. This approach allows students to continue their educational activities from the safety and comfort of their homes, ensuring that the disruption to the learning process is minimized.

Parents and guardians are being informed through official school communication channels, including emails, text messages, and automated phone calls. School districts are also utilizing social media platforms to disseminate information about the cancellation and any additional details regarding remote learning plans or make-up days.

Date: January 15, 2024

Los Angeles, CA — Local law enforcement authorities have announced that they are on the hunt for a serial thief who is suspected of stealing merchandise worth approximately $39,000 from various Target stores across Southern California.

The suspect, whose identity remains unknown, has reportedly been involved in a series of thefts spanning several weeks. According to the police, the individual has targeted high-value items, including electronics and designer clothing, from multiple Target locations.

Security footage from the affected stores shows a person of medium build, wearing a baseball cap and a mask, which has made identification challenging. Investigators believe that the suspect operates primarily during peak shopping hours, blending in with regular customers to avoid suspicion.

“We are dealing with a highly skilled individual who knows exactly what they are doing,” said Detective Maria Lopez of the Los Angeles Police Department. “The pattern of thefts and the manner in which they are conducted suggest that this person is not a novice.”

The string of thefts has prompted Target to increase security measures across their Southern California stores. A spokesperson for Target stated, “The safety and security of our guests and team members is our top priority. We are working closely with law enforcement and have enhanced our security protocols.”

Local police are asking for the public's assistance in identifying the suspect. Anyone with information regarding these thefts or the suspect’s identity is encouraged to contact the Los Angeles Police Department.

The LAPD has also warned other retailers in the area to be vigilant, as the thief may potentially target other stores.

This series of thefts adds to a growing concern over retail crime in Southern California, an issue that has seen an uptick in recent months. Law enforcement agencies are urging retailers to report suspicious activities and to cooperate in ongoing investigations to help curb this trend.

"Indian and Balinese textiles feature in this collaboration between Bharatanatyam and Balinese dance .

"Indian and Balinese textiles feature in this collaboration between Bharatanatyam and Balinese dance .

The traditional dance of Bali is expressive and seeks to tell a story. A similar sensibility ran through Craft in Dance, an exhibition of dance costumes displayed at M.Rm.Rm Cultural Foundation in MRC Nagar early this week.

Curated by the founder, Visalakshi Ramaswamy, the costumes were from the Indian and Balinese textiles for the dance production Arisi: Rice to be performed in the city on January 15. Heavily influenced by the rice culture in both Bali and India, the production as well as the inspiration behind the exhibit lie in the day-to-day impact of paddy cultivation.

“Arisi is a collaborative work between Balinese dance and Bharatanatyam,” says Mohanapriyan Thavarajah, the lead dancer and designer of the costumes. He is part of Apsaras Arts, a dance production company based in Singapore. “We wanted to tell the story of rice, as it is the staple of many Asian countries, and Bali was one of the first places to export rice all over the world.”

Mohanapriyan has drawn inspiration from common beliefs shared by the two cultures to weave costumes that tell a story. The costumes, which have been made using traditional Indian and Balinese textiles and prints, describe the process of paddy cultivation through the patterns and colours used.

Using the fabric of ikat, Balinese costumes, usually worn like a sarong, are redefined. The inspiration for Indian costumes comes from kosavam sarees with pleats at the back, usually worn by women in villages for functional use. A running motif that can be seen is a sickle to denote harvest. The first dance costume on display, in varying gradations of green, was inspired by the landscape of Tamil Nadu’s rice fields. The dance for which this costume is worn depicts a bird’s eye view of a paddy field, says Mohanapriyan.

“One side of the costume is light green, and the other, dark green. The dark green denotes the marshy ground in the paddy fields, and the lighter green denotes the tender leaf of the paddy stock,” he says. A single, running border for the costume denotes a single stock of paddy. He has also used beads to depict rice grains. “In terms of cultural beliefs, we have a lot of similarities,” says Mohanapriyan about the collaboration between Bharatanatyam and Balinese dance.",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/indian-and-balinese-textiles-feature-in-this-collaboration-between-bharatanatyam-and-balinese-dance/article67722472.ece,real,0

Rotary Global Grant to save young lives

Mysore/Mysuru: The impact of COVID-19 has been very severe in India. After the first two waves, health infrastructure and preparedness have improved particularly in urban areas, but not so much outside the big cities. The threat of a 3rd wave is still around and children could be particularly vulnerable as they are not vaccinated. Hence, it is very important to augment both public and private facilities in terms of proper critical care equipment.

In this context, Rotary Mysore embarked on a project of providing ventilators and other life-saving equipment to Vivekananda Memorial Hospital at Sargur, a predominantly rural area. This hospital is setting up an additional full-fledged 6-bed ICU facility with two more Paediatric beds for Covid treatment.

Rotary Mysore, with the support of Rotary District 3181, Rotary District 6380, Rotary Club of Troy USA, Rotary Club of York USA and Rotary Club of Charlotte Hall USA, secured a global grant of 36,533 dollars from The Rotary Foundation and is gifting two ventilators for the treatment of COVID affected children, two baby warmers and a phototherapy equipment for the infected babies who require to be kept warm most of the time during treatment as well as two patient para-monitors.

The project was undertaken through The Mysore Rotary Club Charitable Trust and is granted under Rotary’s focus area of disease prevention and treatment.

"Provo’s music scene highlighted on ‘World Cafe’ series ‘Sense of Place’.

In an exciting showcase of local talent and vibrant culture, Provo’s music scene has been thrust into the national spotlight through the acclaimed ‘World Cafe’ radio series ‘Sense of Place.’ This feature segment explores the rich tapestry of musical artistry found in various cities around the globe, and Provo has been selected as a beacon of burgeoning talent and eclectic sounds.

The ‘Sense of Place’ series, known for its deep dives into the local flavors and community stories that define a city's music identity, has turned its ears towards the sounds emanating from the mountain-ringed city of Provo, Utah. The episode dedicated to Provo aired this week, capturing the hearts of listeners nationwide with its intimate interviews, on-the-ground experiences, and, of course, live sessions featuring a selection of Provo’s finest musicians.

The feature began with a historical overview of Provo’s musical evolution, charting its journey from a quiet college town to a hive of creative musical expression. It highlighted the city's unique blend of genres, from indie rock to folk and beyond, which has been nurtured in local venues, including the famous Velour Live Music Gallery.

Listeners were treated to anecdotes and insights from local artists, venue owners, and music producers, who spoke passionately about the supportive and collaborative community that has been instrumental in Provo's musical success. These testimonials painted a picture of a close-knit scene where artists are encouraged to experiment and thrive.

In a particularly moving segment, the broadcast featured live performances recorded at local hotspots, showcasing the raw, authentic talent that Provo offers. These performances not only captured the energy and spirit of the city’s music but also allowed listeners from afar to experience the sense of community that Provo's music scene embodies.

The ‘World Cafe’ visit to Provo also cast light on the role of Brigham Young University in fostering young talent, with several breakout bands and artists crediting the university's programs for honing their skills.

The article wrapped up with reflections on the future of Provo’s music scene, emphasizing that while the city may not be as large as other musical meccas, it stands tall in its commitment to cultivating genuine, heartfelt music. With its newfound national recognition, Provo's musicians and fans are eager to see how their scene will continue to grow and resonate with audiences worldwide, maintaining a sense of place that is distinctly their own.","i have a news article title ""Provo’s music scene highlighted on ‘World Cafe’ series ‘Sense of Place’"", generate a news article based on that.",fake,1
"Provo’s music scene highlighted on ‘World Cafe’ series ‘Sense of Place’.

Now it’s Provo’s turn in the spotlight.

On Thursday, Provo will join the series “Sense of Place” hosted by “World Cafe,” a daily music and interview program distributed by NPR that highlights the music scene in cities around the world. The program has been to LA; Austin, Texas; London; Vienna; Melbourne, Australia; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; Dublin; and Madrid, but one of their most recent visits was to the Utah County seat.

Nestled in the valley, surrounded by overwhelming, snowcapped mountains is the seemingly quiet town of Provo, said “World Cafe” host Raina Douris, but when they walked around the city’s streets they found a bustling and vibrant culture of music ranging from rap, indie, gospel, pop and much more.

Douris said while they have explored big cities in the past, lately they have been interested in exploring the music in cities people would not think of right away as having a rich music culture. “World Cafe” visited Provo for four days in November to speak to musicians and venues and experience the culture. The team consisted of Douris, contributing host Stephen Kallao, Senior Producer Kimberly Junod and Producer Miguel Perez.

As Douris explained, they have been excited about what they have discovered so far, and surprised at how much is going on in these small cities. “We mostly are just looking for places that feel like they have a lot going on but that your average person who doesn’t live in that city, and maybe has never been there, wouldn’t know,” she said.

The Provo series of “Sense of Place” will premiere Thursday and a new episode will be released around noon (Mountain time) every weekday through Jan. 26. It can be listened to on the hundreds of radio stations across the world that tune into “World Cafe,” at Worldcafe.org, online at World Cafe on NPR Music or through their podcast: “World Cafe Words and Music Podcast.”

The “Sense of Place: Provo, Utah” series will contain seven episodes highlighting local musicians and venues that give up-and-coming artists a chance to be heard. Creators spoke to representatives of Velour Live Music Gallery and ABG’s Libation Emporium and with artists including The Aces, The National Parks, Melody Clinger of The Clinger Sisters, Little Moon and JTM. They also spoke to Zach Collier of Provo Music Magazine and Scott Wiley of June Audio among other musical influencers and artists in Provo.

Those tuning in will experience a variety of sounds from local Provo musicians as well as hear the stories of their journey as artists. The Daily Herald sat down with John-Ross Boyce, the talent booker at ABG’s and a designer of promotional posters, to hear about his experience with “World Cafe” and his thoughts about Provo’s music culture.

Boyce gave a preview of what listeners can expect to gain from tuning in. “I hope what they get out of it is pleasant surprise. … I hope that whoever’s listening maybe respects the town a little bit more, respects it as a place where good art flourishes.”

Many people, even those who grew up in Provo, he said, sometimes do not realize or appreciate the unique music and art culture that Provo offers. He hopes these episodes change that.

When Douris and her team came to Provo, they had already picked out the artists and venue owners/organizers they were going to interview. However, they were surprised at the richness of the music culture present here as they walked around and spoke to the local musicians.

Douris explained that people often make assumptions about places that are usually proven wrong when they visit and dive deep into the culture. For Utah, she said, there is the assumption that there are a bunch of “Mormons” who are good, calm and quiet. She said, “I really hope that what they (listeners) find out is it’s really interesting and vibrant.”

Boyce said these assumptions are what fuels which bands he books for ABG’s. He focuses on having bands that bring original, unique music to Provo listeners and others from out of town. He hopes people coming through will enjoy the music and see and hear something they couldn’t find anywhere else.

More insight into Boyce’s process of interacting with local artists is featured in the episode airing Jan. 22. Boyce will talk about how ABG’s pays their performing bands to help them grow and why that is such a priority for him as a former member of a band that played there in the past.

Sharing her observations of Provo, Douris said: “It’s like a quiet mountain town that makes a lot of music. It’s like it’s deceptively quiet; there’s a lot going on. It’s a really interesting place and it’s way more than this sort of one-dimensional idea people might have about it.” She hopes this series provides more dimensions and nuances for people who may not know anything about Utah, let alone think of it as having a music scene that is alive and diverse.

This series dives into the wide variety of music offered in Provo but discovers a common theme of religion, specifically of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and how it is integrated into artists’ music in some way or another.

Boyce explained that as he has worked with hundreds of bands, he has noticed how connections to the church, whether positive or negative, affect Provo artists and “creates very impassioned musicians.”

“You have people that are impassioned, really spiritual about their music, and that can take a number of different forms,” he said. “Then you have people that feel the fire of social and religious oppression, from their personal experience.” Both kinds, he added, react to their experiences through their art.

When Douris visited Provo, she saw the influence of religion within the musical community as well. She said as she spoke to local artists, she discovered a particular importance placed on music within the Utah community because of the importance of music in the church. Many who grew up in Provo and were taught the importance of music have extended that value onto more than just gospel music, which has helped to create the culture of Provo.

Douris explained how the music culture of Provo differs from the other cities they have visited for this series, saying, “There was a real pioneering spirit, basically, to every person.” She connected this pioneering spirit to the importance of the Latter-day Saint pioneers to members of the community.

A few of these pioneering spirits who are highlighted in the radio series are JTM, who is one of the first Latter-day Saint rappers to teach about the gospel through his music; Melody Clinger, who led her sisters in starting the first female rock and roll band titled The Clinger Sisters, with each woman playing their own instrument; and ABG’s, the first and only standalone bar in Provo with live music. But there are many more, Douris added.

“I really found that at the same time as there was this collaborative and caring spirit in the music community, the people who are making the music, there’s like a real kind of fearlessness to it,” she said.

She explained that as people listen to the series, they will hear the stories of these artists who were the first to try something and hear how it didn’t always work out as they planned. “Being first, being a trailblazer, doesn’t always mean that you get to enjoy all of the things that you’ve blazed the trail towards. But I really found that that was the theme that stuck out to me — there was this pioneering spirit that people had when it came to making music and when it came to fostering the scene there,” Douris said.

While many cities are known as a birthplace of different genres of music, Boyce said for Provo, “It’s not the birthplace of any one particular thing.” He explained Provo’s art scene has become a place where unique people from all different backgrounds can express themselves. “Provo’s identity, from an artistic perspective, is one of unlikely depth and one of unlikely breadth.”

There is not one object or sign that represents Provo, he said, because “it is a surprisingly diverse, artistic landscape.”

In December, users of the audio streaming app Spotify received a personalized recap of their listening habits called Spotify Wrapped, which this year included a “sound town” matching their musical preferences. Many people across the U.S. received Provo as their sound town. KUER reported that as Spotify users looked into the artists they listened to and where they originated, they were surprised to find many originated in Provo, including Little Moon, who will be featured on “World Cafe” in the Provo series.

Paired with the additional exposure through the “Sense of Place” series, it’s helping put Utah County music on the map.",https://www.heraldextra.com/entertainment/music/2024/jan/17/provos-music-scene-highlighted-on-world-cafes-sense-of-place-series/,real,0
"‘Courier boys’ take elderly couple hostage, rob them.

Title: ""Quick-Thinking Neighbor Rescues Elderly Couple Held Hostage by 'Courier Boys' in Daring Robbery""

In a shocking incident that unfolded yesterday, an elderly couple fell victim to a home invasion orchestrated by individuals posing as courier service personnel. The assailants, who disguised themselves as delivery boys, took the elderly couple hostage in their own home and proceeded to rob them of their valuables.

The terrifying ordeal began when the unsuspecting couple opened the door, expecting a routine package delivery. To their dismay, the 'courier boys' forced their way into the residence, brandishing what appeared to be weapons. The elderly couple was then held hostage while the criminals ransacked their home, searching for cash, jewelry, and other valuable items.

However, amidst the chaos, a quick-thinking neighbor noticed the commotion and suspected that something was amiss. The neighbor promptly alerted local law enforcement and rushed to the aid of the elderly couple. Realizing they were being watched, the criminals attempted to flee the scene, but law enforcement arrived just in time to apprehend them.

Police spokesperson, Detective Sarah Turner, provided details of the arrest, stating, ""Our officers responded swiftly to the neighbor's call, and with the help of the vigilant community member, we were able to apprehend the suspects before they could escape. The elderly couple is shaken but thankfully unharmed.""

Authorities have identified the suspects as members of a criminal gang known for posing as delivery personnel to gain access to homes for robbery purposes. Investigations are ongoing to determine if the gang is responsible for similar incidents in the area.

The local community has expressed gratitude for the neighbor's courage and quick response, emphasizing the importance of vigilant neighbors in ensuring the safety of residents. The incident serves as a reminder for individuals to exercise caution when opening their doors to strangers, even those claiming to be delivery personnel.

As the legal proceedings unfold, the 'courier boys' are expected to face charges related to home invasion, robbery, and unlawful restraint. The elderly couple, meanwhile, is receiving support from local victim advocacy organizations to cope with the aftermath of this harrowing experience.","Generate a news article based on the title: ""‘Courier boys’ take elderly couple hostage, rob them""",fake,1
"‘Courier boys’ take elderly couple hostage, rob them.

Panchkula: Monday night turned out to be a scariest chapter for an elderly couple in a housing society in Panchkula’s Sector 20 as robbers, in disguise, held them hostage at knifepoint for some 30-odd minutes before taking away gold jewellery and some cash. The woman was injured in the incident.

With their children settled in the US and Canada, Vinay Kakkar (73), a retired banker, and his wife Suman Kakkar did not feel anything unusual when two men (in masks) rang the doorbell around 8 pm and one of them introduced himself as a courier boy “who had come to deliver an international parcel.”

But as soon Vinay opened the door and stepped outside to collect the parcel, one of the miscreants took out a knife and the other covered his wife’s mouth.
When he tried to raise an alarm, the accused dragged the elderly couple into a room in their apartment, taped their mouths and tied their hands with a strap.
The accused first snatched two gold rings, a gold chain from Vinay and gold earrings from his wife, injuring her ear badly. The accused then searched the house looking for valuables, but could find only Rs 4,000 kept in a cupboard. The duo later fled the spot, leaving the victims in the same condition.

After much struggle, Suman somehow managed to release her hands from the strap and then called her neighbours for help. Thereafter, a call to the police control room was made. A team of police along with forensic experts visited the crime scene. They checked CCTV camera and entry record register of the society to gather clues about the accused.
Police also got the medical examination of Suman conducted. Based on Vinay’s complaint, police registered a case under Sections 380 (theft at dwelling house, etc.), 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 120-B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. Inspector Virender, SHO, Sector 20 police station, said, “The accused had information about the couple living alone and we are working to trace them.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/robbery-courier-boys-take-elderly-couple-hostage-in-panchkulas-sector-20/articleshow/106682526.cms,real,0
"Norwalk explores creating pedestrian path that runs through Darien and Stamford to Greenwich.

NORWALK — Norwalk aims to enhance connectivity to Greenwich by exploring options to connect the surrounding towns with a pedestrian path.

“There is a larger regional initiative underway right now called the Fairfield County Greenway Partnership, which is a coalition of advocates, city employees, and city leadership from towns up and down the coast from Greenwich up to Bridgeport,” explained Tanner Thompson, chair of Norwalk’s Bike/Walk Commission during its meeting Monday night.

Greenwich and Stamford were awarded a $270,400 grant from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to create design plans for a 2.6-mile trail between the coastal communities. The remaining cost for the plans, $67,600, will be split between Stamford and Greenwich.

Thompson said he was approached about Norwalk joining in on the plan.

“It might be a good time for Norwalk to start thinking about the next phase of this idea, which would be to extend the trail concept from Stamford through Darien to Norwalk,” Thompson said.

Through contacts in Darien, Thompson said he would be reaching out to the town’s Board of Selectmen.

Without a route in mind, Thompson and the Bike/Walk Commission plan to submit for the same grant Stamford and Greenwich were awarded. If awarded a grant, the funds will be used to devise a plan.

“The Connecticut recreational trails grant is one of several grant programs that the state offers to provide money for infrastructure relating to walking and biking,” Thompson explained.

While the Bike/Walk Commission will take the lead on the grant application, city staff members from Transportation, Parking, and Mobility like Greg Pacelli said they would help fine-tune the details. Thompson said the grant application is due March 11.

The Greenwich to Stamford path is estimated to cost $4 million and take over 12 to 18 months, according to preliminary DPW estimates. The path would connect Binney Park in Old Greenwich to Boccuzzi Park in southwest Stamford, but the exact route hasn't been determined. 

“What this trail program means is how we try and interconnect our towns and cities with each other and to other outdoor recreational space,” Gov. Ned Lamont said when the state grant was announced this past spring. “We've got to really be careful about preserving what we got and rebuilding what we've got.” 

Increasing connectivity and walkability are goals for the city of Norwalk. This initiative comes as Norwalk continues to expand the Norwalk River Valley Trail, which, when complete, will connect Norwalk to Danbury.

In 2023, Norwalk finished up the latest portion of the trail along Riverside Avenue. Plans to connect the Norwalk trail to the Wilton portion are expected to be included with the Merritt Parkway and Route 7 interchange project.",https://www.thehour.com/news/article/norwalk-trail-connecting-stamford-greenwich-18598430.php,real,0
"Norwalk explores creating pedestrian path that runs through Darien and Stamford to Greenwich.

Norwalk, Connecticut - In an exciting initiative aimed at promoting connectivity and enhancing the quality of life for residents and visitors alike, the city of Norwalk is exploring the creation of a pedestrian path that would stretch from Norwalk through Darien and Stamford, culminating in the picturesque town of Greenwich. This ambitious project has the potential to create a scenic and accessible route, fostering a stronger sense of community and encouraging outdoor activities.
Connecting Communities, Promoting Wellness

The proposed pedestrian path, which is still in the early planning stages, envisions a scenic route that weaves through some of Fairfield County's most charming and vibrant towns. It would provide walkers, joggers, and cyclists with a safe and enjoyable path to traverse the region, all while taking in the natural beauty and urban landscapes along the way.

One of the primary goals of this project is to promote wellness and an active lifestyle. Residents and visitors will have the opportunity to explore these communities by foot or bicycle, which can lead to healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation.
Collaboration Among Neighboring Towns

Creating such a path would require a collaborative effort among multiple municipalities. Leaders from Norwalk, Darien, Stamford, and Greenwich have expressed their interest in working together to make this vision a reality. The proposed path would traverse several miles, passing through parks, scenic waterfronts, and other points of interest.

Each town along the route would contribute to the path's development, ensuring that it is well-maintained, safe, and enjoyable for everyone. The collaborative effort highlights the commitment of these communities to foster connectivity and create a unique regional attraction.
Economic Benefits and Tourism

Beyond the health and wellness benefits, this pedestrian path has the potential to boost the local economy. By connecting different communities and providing easy access to various points of interest, the path could attract tourists and outdoor enthusiasts. Cafes, restaurants, and shops along the route may experience increased foot traffic, providing an economic boost to the area.

Additionally, such a path could become a destination for those looking for a day of exploration. Families, nature lovers, and history buffs may all find something to enjoy along this picturesque route.
Environmental Considerations

In today's world, environmental sustainability is a top priority. The development of a pedestrian path offers an opportunity to incorporate eco-friendly features, such as green spaces, energy-efficient lighting, and proper waste management. It can also encourage people to leave their cars at home, reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion in the region.
Public Input and Feedback

The proposal for the Norwalk-to-Greenwich pedestrian path is still in its early stages, and local officials are eager to gather input and feedback from residents. Community meetings and public forums will be held to ensure that the path aligns with the desires and needs of the people it aims to serve.

Residents and stakeholders are encouraged to participate in these discussions and share their ideas about the path's design, amenities, and potential points of interest along the way.
A Vision for a More Connected Future

The exploration of this pedestrian path is a testament to the commitment of Norwalk and its neighboring towns to creating a more connected and vibrant community. By embracing the principles of wellness, collaboration, and sustainability, this project has the potential to become a shining example of what can be achieved when communities work together to enhance the quality of life for all.

As the planning process unfolds and more details emerge, the Norwalk-to-Greenwich pedestrian path promises to be an exciting project that will benefit the region for generations to come. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting initiative that could redefine how residents and visitors experience Fairfield County's natural beauty and vibrant communities.","Create an article that has the following title:

"Large tree falls on top of several cars at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

A sudden and unexpected incident occurred at Golden Gate Park today as a large tree toppled over, crashing onto several parked cars near the popular attraction's entrance. The incident took place earlier this [morning/afternoon/evening], sending shockwaves through the community and prompting immediate response from local authorities.

Eyewitnesses reported a loud cracking sound followed by a thunderous crash as the massive tree, estimated to be decades old, succumbed to unknown causes. The incident occurred in the vicinity of the park's main entrance, where visitors often park their vehicles while exploring the iconic destination.

Emergency services rushed to the scene within minutes, assessing the situation and ensuring the safety of park visitors and onlookers. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, as the incident took place at a time when the area was relatively less crowded.

Local authorities, including the San Francisco Fire Department and Park Rangers, swiftly cordoned off the affected area to prevent any potential hazards. The fallen tree left a trail of destruction, damaging several vehicles in its path. Car owners arrived to find their vehicles buried under branches and debris.

""It was like a scene from a movie. I heard the tree cracking, and then everything happened so fast. I can't believe my car got caught under it,"" said a shocked park visitor who witnessed the incident.

The cleanup operation is underway, with crews working diligently to remove the fallen tree and debris. Heavy equipment, including cranes and chainsaws, has been brought in to expedite the process and reopen the affected area to the public.

Golden Gate Park officials are collaborating with arborists to investigate the cause of the tree's collapse. Initial assessments suggest that a combination of factors, including weather conditions and the tree's age, may have contributed to the incident. The park administration assures the public that a thorough examination will be conducted to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Visitors are advised to exercise caution and adhere to any temporary closures or safety measures implemented by park authorities. The incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of mature trees and the importance of regular maintenance to ensure the safety of park-goers.

As the cleanup continues, questions linger about the fate of other aging trees within the park. Authorities are committed to conducting a comprehensive review of the park's greenery to address potential risks and implement necessary measures to uphold the safety of visitors.","Write a news article with the title ""Large tree falls on top of several cars at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco""",fake,1
"Large tree falls on top of several cars at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

Nearly a dozen people escaped a giant tree slamming onto their cars in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park Monday.

At about 4 p.m., a 130-foot-tall eucalyptus tree came down across Crossover Drive near 19th Avenue.

Five cars with 11 people inside were impacted.

Sandy Yeung was inside her blue Tesla when the tree came down. She said her first thought was, “Seriously, are we dead?” 

“We have a glass rooftop and this big tree and lamp post came crashing down and you hear this big boom and all the windows cracked,” she said. “My first reaction was, ‘is there blood?” Because there was glass everywhere.”

Yeung looked and saw that she, her daughter, son and husband were unscratched. And, except for two minor injuries, so were the seven other people in the four other cars, also hit by the massive tree. 

A San Francisco Fire Department spokesperson said this story easily could’ve had a tragic ending.

“I think it’s important to note that these vehicles were in motion when this tree fell down and had the tree fallen a second later, we would be looking at a much worse scene behind us than what we are seeing right now,” said SFFD Captain Jonathan Baxter.

No word yet from the city on why the entire tree toppled out of the blue.

Initially, the tree blocked all lanes of Highway 1 through Golden Gate Park, but soon a couple of northbound lanes were opened.

The three southbound lanes remain closed for hours, causing a massive traffic jam all around that section of Golden Gate Park.

Crews came out to cut up the tree, load it  on trucks and get it out of here and all of a sudden, just like that, Golden Gate Park was back to normal and looking like nothing had ever happened.

But Yeung knows otherwise.

“Somebody was telling me we have a guardian angel watching over all of us today,” she said.",https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/tree-falls-on-cars-san-francisco/3423218/?Sdc/,real,0
"190 newly-elected members of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly take oath.

Chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma took the oath first, followed by deputy chief ministers Diya Kumari and Prem Chand Bairwa, respectively

As many as 190 of the 199 newly elected members of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly took the oath on Wednesday, and the rest will take it on Thursday. Elections on 199 out of 200 seats were held in November, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) defeated the ruling Congress.

The first session of 16th legislative assembly began at 11 am with chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma taking the oath first, followed by deputy chief ministers Diya Kumari and Prem Chand Bairwa.

While most members took their oath in Hindi, some of the leaders, including Zubair Khan (Congress) and Yoonus Khan (independent), took their oath in the Sanskrit language.

Other than these two, those who took oath in Sanskrit were Gopal Sharma, Chhagan Singh, Jogeshwar Garg, Noksham Choudhary, Jetanand Vyas, Pabbaram Vishnoi, Mahant Pratappuri, Babu Singh Rathore, Deepti Maheshwari and Kailash Meena. Vasunhara Raje also took oath.

A few MLAs expressed their desire to take oath in local Rajasthani language but were denied by pro-tem speaker Kalicharan Saraff saying that it was not included in the VIII schedule of the Indian Constitution.

The MLAs who remained absent today will be administered oath on Thursday. The election for the post of Speaker will also be held on Thursday. The BJP has already named Vasudev Devnani for the post of Speaker.

This is probably the first time in Rajasthan that the MLAs are being sworn in before the formation of the Cabinet.

Soon after the house proceedings began, Congress MLA and former parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal objected to calling the session on short notice.

The newly formed Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) MLAs came to the house in traditional tribal colourful attire, while independent MLA Ritu Banawat reached the assembly on a tractor, and BJP MLA Jethanand Vyas came riding a bike.

Meanwhile, the Congress MLAs came to the house wearing black ribbons on their arms in protest against the suspension of MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

After taking the oath, Congress MLA from Lacchmangarh (Sikar) and state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra condemned the issue of suspension of MPs but were asked to stop by the pro-tem speaker.

In the 16th legislative assembly, the BJP has 115 MLAs, Congress 69, Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) 3, BSP 2, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) have 1 each, 8 are independents while one seat is vacant",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/190-newly-elected-members-of-rajasthan-legislative-assembly-take-oath-101703073660909.html,real,0

Santa Clara County Fire Department personnel were still investigating the cause of the
three-alarm fire on Monday. No one was injured in the blaze.
The building once held a diverse range of businesses – from caregiver and cultural
centers to esthetic services and children’s training. At least five of the business owners
are immigrants from all over the world.
By the time most of the tenants woke up Christmas morning, the fire had already been
raging for several hours. By the afternoon, they were told what they feared most – that
nothing in the building would be salvageable and that the building would have to be
demolished.
Even as local fire departments were still working to extinguish the fire, people started
mobilizing to help the affected tenants. Kim Mosley, president of the Los Altos Chamber
of Commerce, was one of the first to spring into action. She contacted impacted
businesses and helped make connections with those looking to help. As of last week,
several businesses at 4600 El Camino Real have successfully relocated.
“For some they’ve tried to move on really quickly to try to get right back, you know, to not
lose any business,” Mosley said. “And then there’s some who it’s just been such a shock
that it’s been hard, kind of paralyzing.”
Business owners and people close to them have also started individual GoFundMe
campaigns which have collectively raised more than $100,000. Some businesses whose
insurance did not cover fire damage, like Elizabeth King Electrolysis, will rely heavily on
these funds to restart their businesses.
Others are still waiting on the results of the investigation into the cause of the fire to
determine what compensation they may receive. In any case, people like Leyla
Boissonnade, owner of Bay Area Dance School (BADS), are in need of funds sooner than
the undetermined date that an insurance claim might come through to continue their
work and rebuild.

For now, residents are coming together to seek solutions, spaces and funds for the
tenants.

Managing to relocate

“A total loss of the entire building,” said David Hurd of 4600 El Camino Real. “Our agency
and many other businesses are scrambling.”
Hurd and his wife Duanni run Starlight Caregivers, which provides home care and care
management to aging seniors and the disabled. The Hurds were able to transition
quickly to temporary locations, first in downtown Los Altos, then to office space on San
Antonio Road.
“Luckily, the business is cloud-based documentation so we haven’t had much
downtime,” Hurd said.
Duanni, a member of the Rotary Club of Los Altos, received help from fellow Rotarian
Harry Price, who shared use of his office space, and then from Scott O’Brien, a local real
estate broker who helped place several clients.
Mindy Nguyen, owner of Angel Hair & Nails, had been working at the location for 17 years.
She and her sister were fortunate to find temporary relocation fairly quickly. Nguyen
(whose full story is featured in this week’s business section) is now at Krsto Hair Salon at
Rancho Shopping Center until she can find a permanent location, according to Mosley.
One of the longest-running tenants, Via Builders, Inc., had been occupying Suite 209
since the early 2000s.
“The fire was an unfortunate event, losing all our office equipment, hardcopy dated files,
furniture, vehicles, etc. Some we will not be able to recover,” said owner Ralph Saviano.
However, Via, which Saviano founded in 1985, has also proved resilient.
“With a lot of our staff’s hard and immediate work, we have already secured another
office space around the corner on San Antonio Road, have new equipment and furniture
coming in the next few weeks, and hope to be running at almost normal level in about a
month,” Saviano said.

Dojo seeks new home

Raul Tamayo of Tamayo Judo Dojo is still in disbelief that the location where kids met
new friends and built community is gone.
“It was my second home and a second home to a lot of these kids,” Tamayo said.
After spending Christmas day recovering at his cousin’s house in Danville, the Los Altos
resident and former Stanford University judo head coach got to work finding a new
location. Over the past two weeks, he has held makeshift classes on the Egan Junior
High School field for three days before Fantasy Dance School offered them a place.
Tamayo is working with the Santa Clara Police Activities League on finding a new
location for the next few weeks. On average, he teaches about four classes a day and has
about 75 students. He hopes to find a new place in Los Altos or Mountain View and raise
enough money on GoFundMe towards considerable equipment expenses like spring
mats, workout mats and safety gear.
“That’s going to be a big help,” Tamayo said of the GoFundMe. “It’s going to help me get
the material and hopefully start over again.”
Petra Zalar, whose son practices at the dojo, started the GoFundMe on his behalf, which
has raised over $25,000. Her goal is to keep the fundraiser going as long as possible to
help offset costs for the equipment, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Zalar
called Tamayo a humble person who charged reasonable prices and cared that the kids
were educated rather than simply trying to earn belts. In the past, Tamayo has hosted a
potluck for the parents and kids, and each kid brought an ornament for the Christmas
tree.
“I want the world for sensei,” Zalar said. “I want to get him back on his feet.”

Dancers moving

Amid securing temporary rehearsal space, searching for a new rental and dealing with
the other fall out related to the fire, Boissonade spent this past weekend in Seattle
supporting her students competing in Youth American Grand Prix, an annual
international ballet competition in which students can earn awards and scholarships to
prestigious schools around the world.
Since the fire, BADS has benefited both from the support of the local community but
also the wider dance and arts community. Many of the dancers’ personal items, like
expensive tutus and pointe shoes, also went up in smoke on Christmas day, so many of
them who are competing or auditioning for summer and college programs in the
coming weeks have benefited from donations of costumes and shoes. Upon arriving in
Seattle, Boissonade sought help from a local dance store that helped outfit her dancers.
Dance studios across the Bay have lent a hand in providing studio space for class and
rehearsals.
“The community is very good at handling crises and that speaks volumes about people
in the creative arts – they think out of the box and they can handle problems very
quickly,” she told the Town Crier. “Performers are trained to make everything look
completely wonderful onstage but you don’t see the bloody toenails and hours of work
that goes into making everything happen.”
Like Tamayo, Boissonade is seeking to stay in Los Altos, but is facing a lot of hurdles due
to the lack of commercial space available locally. Moving out of the area could risk the
studio losing students during a time where the school is still trying to rebuild to prepandemic enrollment levels.
After finding a space, there comes installing the costly infrastructure needed to provide a
safe environment for dancers to train at a high level. She was quoted $26,000 for the
sprung flooring alone – not to mention the mirrors, barres, mats, stretching equipment
and dressing rooms. However, no amount of money could replace the photos, trophies,
decade worth of performance DVDs and the library of ballet books lost in the flames.
A GoFundMe campaign started by a BADS alumnus the evening of the fire has raised
$45,000 of its $100,000 goal. Boissonade is looking out for leads on potential spaces to
rent.
“We love the community of Los Altos – it’s a place that supports and invests a lot in their
children…,” she said. “We still want to be a part of this community.”
Other businesses
The Zhaoyu Cultural Foundation Books and Me Library, occupying Suite 205, also “lost
everything,” including thousands of books and other media, plus the destruction of its
art studio and collection of student artwork.
The cultural space is seeking donations to be able to start its educational programs on

"New business to come to old Kmart building in Watsonville.

A little more than two years after the former Kmart store on Freedom Boulevard closed its doors, the space will soon have a new tenant. 

Vallarta Supermarket, which has more than 50 locations throughout California—the most recent one in Salinas—will occupy half of the 100,000-square-foot building. A co-tenant, which is yet to be determined, will take the other half.

Watsonville City Councilman Jimmy Dutra, whose district includes the location at 1702 Freedom Blvd., says he took a tour recently of one of the company’s locations in Southern California. 

He describes it as “a shopping experience” that will offer everything a typical grocery store has, in addition to a flower shop, a juice bar, a restaurant, a bakery, a meat and fish market and a variety of ethnic foods including Mexican, Filipino and Portuguese. 

“They’re really big and they have a huge variety,” he said. “It’s going to have everything.”

Dutra said he is pushing the city to also make improvements to the adjacent buildings and businesses.

While the city council is tasked with overseeing zoning and ordinance changes that affect the city, Dutra said, they cannot legally deny—or approve—any business that wants to open in Watsonville and meets the requirements. 

“I know some people will be upset about another grocery store, but if companies meet the application process—the city cannot deny them a permit,” he said. 

Dutra said that the new business will hire 200 people.

“The bright side is this shopping center has been filled with blight and run down and it is about to get a new look and become vibrant again,” he said. 

Vallarta Supermarkets Chief Operations Officer Cesar Gonzalez said the store is slated to open in May.

The family-operated chain began in Van Nuys in 1985, Gonzalez said. 

He stressed that the company’s stores go beyond the “cookie cutter” stores that focus solely on Hispanic and Mexican foods.

In addition to all conventional groceries, he says, they also have specialty items including vegan and organic and fresh made sushi. 

This is in addition to Mexican and Hispanic food, the store will offer Middle Eastern, Indian, Creole, Southern Soul Food, Korean and Filipino foods. 

The store will also offer a station with made-to-order guacamole made daily from avocados cut in front of the customers.",New business to come to old Kmart building in Watsonville,real,0

"More urban space bolsters goal of a 'city in the parks'.

Shanghai has added another 162 parks this year, bringing the total to 832 and making a significant step towards its goal of ""a city in the parks.""

Of the 832 parks, 265 are pocket parks (small outdoor public spaces covering an area of between 400 to 10,000 square meters) and 381 are open day and night, according to the Shanghai Greenery and Public Sanitation Bureau.

Parks in Shanghai are not just places to relax or take a stroll. In fact, people can now appreciate art and enjoy sports activities at many such green spaces.

Shanghai is developing a number of parks with multiple functions and dozens of parks across the city have already introduced sports, art and cultural elements to enrich the visitor experience, according to the bureau.

Around 200 activities are rolled out at these parks throughout the year.

Meanwhile, parks are being turned into ""ecological parlors"" of the city.

Heping Park in Hongkou District has introduced a bookstore with a collection of more than 1,500 journals, while Lujiazui Central Greenland in the Pudong New Area has been hosting coffee-themed activities such as a coffee culture festival. A pop-up cafe, Coffee Cube, has started trial operation in the park.

Gumei Park in Minhang District is the first in China to display around 130 pieces of furniture.

Parks have also become sports and fitness venues, the bureau said, and nearly 300 parks in urban areas have been installed with fitness and sports facilities.

Xujiahui Park in Xuhui District features a number of such facilities such as basketball court, fitness track and table tennis venue, and Gongqing Forest Park and Binjiang Forest Park have introduced activities such as fishing and walking to raise health awareness among the public.",https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/nw48088/20231228/ef4d1d0485f64cd9b120b2b5cef32907.html,real,0
"More urban space bolsters goal of a 'city in the parks'.

In an ambitious move to blend urban living with the serenity of nature, the city council has announced a pioneering project: transforming the city into a 'city in the parks'. This initiative aims to integrate expansive green spaces into the urban landscape, thereby redefining the concept of city living.

The project, spearheaded by Mayor Jane Doe, seeks to allocate significant portions of the city's budget to expand existing parks, create new green spaces, and integrate nature into public and private buildings. ""Our vision is to create an urban environment where nature and city life are not just coexisting, but are intertwined,"" Mayor Doe explained in a recent press conference.

Key elements of the project include:

Expansion of Existing Parks: Existing parks will see an increase in size, with more trees, walking paths, and public amenities like benches and picnic areas.

New Green Spaces: Underutilized urban areas, such as abandoned lots and rooftops, will be transformed into vibrant green spaces, community gardens, and mini-parks.

Green Building Initiatives: New building regulations will encourage the incorporation of green roofs, vertical gardens, and natural ventilation systems in both residential and commercial buildings.

Community Involvement: The project emphasizes community participation, with plans to involve local schools, businesses, and residents in the design and maintenance of these green spaces.

Environmental experts have lauded this initiative as a significant step towards sustainable urban living. Dr. Emily Green, a professor of Urban Ecology, remarked, ""This project is not just about beautifying the city, but about creating a healthier, more livable urban environment. Integrating nature into the city can have profound effects on air quality, temperature regulation, and even residents' mental health.""

While the project is ambitious, it faces challenges, particularly in terms of funding and logistical planning. However, the city council remains optimistic, with Mayor Doe stating, ""We are committed to overcoming these challenges. The goal of a 'city in the parks' is not just a dream, but a necessary step towards a sustainable future.""

Residents have expressed mixed reactions. While many welcome the green transformation, some business owners are concerned about the potential disruption during the construction phase. The city council plans to hold a series of public forums to address these concerns and gather input from the community.

As the project moves forward, the city stands on the brink of becoming a model for urban green living, inspiring other cities worldwide to reconsider their relationship with nature.",write a news article with this title: More urban space bolsters goal of a 'city in the parks',fake,1

"Driver believed to be going 153 mph in Tempe crash that killed two passengers.

TEMPE, AZ — A man has been arrested after allegedly causing a car crash that killed two passengers in his vehicle.

The incident happened early Saturday morning near Rural and Broadway roads.

Police say officers had attempted to stop the Ford Mustang moments earlier near Rural and Terrace roads for street racing in excess of 100 miles per hour. The vehicle fled from officers and crashed moments later.

Both of the passengers died because of the crash, one at the scene and the other at a hospital. They have been identified as 31-year-old Maria Rangel and 32-year-old Jesse Ruiz.

Police believe the suspect, 32-year-old Derek Glasscock, was impaired and driving approximately 153 miles per hour when he lost control of the vehicle and crashed. It's unclear how far away officers were at the time of the crash, but they say they did not attempt to follow the Mustang after it fled.

Officers say the vehicle went airborne and struck a power pole and two palm trees before landing. One of the victims was ejected, struck a palm tree, and landed approximately 80 feet away. She later died from her injuries at a hospital. A male passenger died at the scene.

ABC15 spoke with Max Aguino, Rangel's brother, who says his sister and Ruiz were dating for over a year, and were close to moving into a house together.

“My sister was full of light,” said Aguino. “She was happy. She was a beautiful soul, and a beautiful person.”

Aguino is hoping and working to learn more details.

“I need to know, but it’s not going to help,” said Aguino.

This loss just five years after Max lost his mom to cancer. Now the family is raising funds to make sure Rangel can be buried with her.

The family has created an online fundraiser to help with funeral costs.

Glasscock suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital and released into police custody. He faces two counts of manslaughter.

"Reading across generations: Seniors get a special story time, courtesy of Bird Rock Elementary students.

Participating in service projects and other efforts to brighten the world around them is nothing new for the students in Kristi Nelson’s first-grade classroom at Bird Rock Elementary School. But this year’s project took a new approach.

One of the annual projects involves taking a field trip in December to Ivy Park at La Jolla, an assisted-living facility, to sing to the senior citizens living there. But this year, the trip was flipped, and on Oct. 3 the seniors took a field trip to the school for a special story time.

“I’ve been wanting to do this for a long time, because we go [to Ivy Park] three times a year for various events. I’ve asked many times if they could come to us, and this year they have a new director that agreed,” Nelson said.

When the four seniors arrived, they were split into two groups and went into two first-grade classrooms, where students were waiting. Everyone sat in a circle and one by one, the students read to the seniors and to each other.

“It was a fun little experience,” Nelson said. The chance to get to know the seniors and read in small groups “brought a new level of connection for us. … It connected the two communities,” she added.

Six-year-old Beckett Smith said the class “wanted [the Ivy Park residents] to feel loved and let them know they have people that care about them, and they know we are there for them when they need us. … I thought I was going to burst with happiness.”

Classmate Ivet Geva Carrasco, also 6, said the experience made her feel “joyful” and “really good.”

For Sloan Ziegelbauer, 7, her favorite part was taking photos and making a poster for the seniors to have back at Ivy Park.

The annual projects in Nelson’s class are inspired by the poem “The Boy and the Starfish,” adapted from an essay by Loren Eiseley. The poem is about a child making a difference to one starfish on the beach.

“It’s about helping one person at a time,” Nelson said. “My hope is that they will learn this is something important for them to do, to take care of other people. ... By having this connection and seeing them again [in December], they might have a deeper connection. The reward they have is that it makes them feel like a good person.”

Other class projects this year included making cards and coloring pages for those affected by the Maui wildfires and having a police officer visit the classroom so the children could thank him for his service.

Next calendar year, the class will hold a shoe drive for Soles 4 Souls and a food drive for Meals on Wheels, followed by a beach cleanup and other service projects.

This month, the Torrey Pines Rotary Club gave the class $500 to help pay for supplies and to purchase goods to be donated.

"Reading across generations: Seniors get a special story time, courtesy of Bird Rock Elementary students.

In a heartwarming initiative to bridge generational gaps and promote a love for reading, students from Bird Rock Elementary School organized a special story time for seniors in the La Jolla community. The event, held at the local community center, brought together young students and elderly residents for an afternoon of shared stories and connections.

The event kicked off with a warm welcome from the students, who prepared a diverse selection of books suitable for all ages. As the seniors settled into comfortable chairs, the young readers enthusiastically began to share tales ranging from classic children's stories to more contemporary works.

Mrs. Hernandez, a resident at the La Jolla Senior Living Center, expressed her delight, saying, ""It's such a joy to see these bright young faces sharing stories with us. It brings back fond memories and creates a sense of unity within the community.""

The initiative not only provided entertainment but also fostered meaningful interactions between the generations. Students took turns reading aloud, and afterward, both students and seniors engaged in discussions about their favorite books, creating a sense of camaraderie and mutual appreciation.

Principal Rodriguez of Bird Rock Elementary highlighted the importance of such intergenerational activities. ""Reading is a universal language that transcends age. Our students gain valuable experiences by connecting with seniors, and the seniors benefit from the youthful energy and enthusiasm of the children.""

Local businesses supported the event by providing snacks and refreshments, creating a cozy atmosphere for the attendees. The success of this initiative has sparked discussions about making it a regular occurrence, with the potential for a monthly ""Reading Across Generations"" program.

As the story time event concluded, smiles and laughter filled the room, leaving a lasting impression on both the young students and the seniors.

"Documentary on Greyston Bakery to Screen at Bronxville Picture House.

Zen Brownie, an award-winning documentary on the story behind Greyston Bakery, will be shown January 25 at The Picture House in Bronxville followed by a panel discussion and special reception featuring famous ice cream makers Ben & Jerry.

Greyston Bakery in Yonkers creates gold standard brownies enjoyed daily around the world through its inclusion in Ben & Jerry’s ice creams. Bakers are employed through an Open Hiring® policy which means no interviews, no background checks, and no resumes are required.

“For 41 years Greyston has been unlocking human potential through inclusive employment. It began with a Buddhist and a bakery and desire to help make communities thrive by being supportive of folks society has cast aside. It has evolved into an employment model known as Open Hiring ®, which is being replicated by a growing number of companies,’’ said Greyston’s CEO & President Joseph Kenner.

Clayton Bushong, Executive Director of The Picture House Regional Film Center, said The Picture House is excited to bring Zen Brownie to its Bronxville theater.

Bartlett (Director/Writer/Producer) said her goal in making the film was to highlight “kind, inclusive, and profitable leadership.”

The film’s producer Michael Pirson, a professor at Fordham University, said, “Our film showcases humanistic business practices that create a world that works for all.”

The film will be shown at The Picture House, 85 Kraft Avenue in Bronxville, at 6:30 p.m. followed by a second feature Wide Open Dreams and a panel discussion featuring the filmmaker, producer, wife of founder Bernie Glassman and Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry’s.

"These Hopewell-Pennington Area Restaurants Got Revitalization Funds.

The Restaurant Revitalization Fund doled out more than $28.6 billion in grants to eateries that sustained financial losses during the pandemic, including several Hopewell-Pennington area restaurants.

The fund was established as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of March 2021. More than 101,000 restaurants received grants as of June 30, according to the Small Business Administration. The average grant size was $283,000.

Restaurants were eligible for up to $10 million in grants, with no more than $5 million per location. Funds don’t have to be repaid if they are used for eligible expenses, such as payroll or rent, through March 11, 2023.

The Restaurant Revitalization Fund received praise from industry members for its simplicity, but many applicants were shut out when funding dried up in June.

Nationwide, restaurants submitted more than 278,000 applications, totaling $72.23 billion in requested aid. Around 177,000 applicants were denied grants.

There was also confusion about prioritization of funds. The SBA originally prioritized funding for restaurants owned by women, veterans and underserved populations. Some business owners sued, and the SBA ended the practice; around 3,000 priority applicants had grants rescinded, according to The New York Times.

The restaurant industry has lost around $290 billion in sales since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the National Restaurant Association. Some 90,000 restaurants closed permanently or long-term.

The bipartisan Restaurant Revitalization Fund Replenishment Act proposal would provide $60 billion in additional funding for the program if passed.

“The success of the RRF so far is, in large part, because the SBA focused on making the program simple and accessible,” NRA Vice President Sean Kennedy said in a statement. “We appreciate how swiftly they were able to establish a program unlike anything they had administrated before, and believe it has the structure to sustain additional funding.”",https://patch.com/new-jersey/hopewell-pennington/these-hopewell-pennington-area-restaurants-got-revitalization-funds,real,0

"Discrimination complaint filed against Katy ISD by SEAT over transgender policy.

Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT), a student-led movement demonstrating youth visibility in educational policymaking, filed a formal complaint of discrimination on November 13th with the U.S. Department of Education regarding a comprehensive anti-transgender policy passed by the Katy Independent School District's Board of Trustees in August, according to a press release posted on the organization’s website.

The Katy Times reached out to Katy ISD for commentary but, due to the holiday closure of the district offices, a response was not received by press time.

The complaint, delivered to the federal department's Office of Civil Rights, challenges the policy's adverse impact on transgender students, asserting violation of Title IX rights with Gender Identity discrimination and perpetuating harmful sex stereotypes and heteronormative gender roles.

In accordance with the policy, Katy ISD evidently outed at least 19 students to their parents, as reported by a Public Information Request by the independent news organization Houston Landing, said the press release. “This negligent enforcement raises serious concerns about privacy and emotional well-being of transgender students, who should be entitled to a safe and inclusive educational environment equal to that of cisgender peers,” the press release continued.

“We used public knowledge as the basis of the complaint because students must be 18+ or obtain parental consent to submit the complaint form, and because of the sensitive nature of this policy, many transgender students without supportive families have had to remain silent,” said SEAT Executive Director Cameron Samuels in an email to the Katy Times. “We do encourage and support students/parents statewide in filing their own complaints if they experience discrimination, and from our understanding, we are the first but not the only to file a complaint against Katy ISD's anti-transgender policy in some regard.”

Samuels, a graduate of Seven Lakes High School, previously testified before the House Judiciary Committee on the Judiciary for a hearing of the Full Committee on ""Book Bans: Examining How Censorship Limits Liberty and Literature"" in Washington, D.C., on September 12th.

Katy ISD’s policy, passed at the district's August 28 board meeting, prompted resounding community opposition with many individuals, including many students, expressing disapproval during more than four hours of impassioned public comments. Despite opposition, the board narrowly voted 4-3 shortly before midnight.

""I’ve seen firsthand how this policy has impacted transgender students, such as hostility and tension between students and educators,"" said Katy ISD sophomore and SEAT organizer Grace Ding. ""Creating barriers for students to access support from trusted adults is a setback to progress made over decades.""

“SEAT is no stranger to increasing hostility by Katy ISD toward LGBTQ+ students in recent years, including unprecedented book bans and internet censorship,” said the SEAT press release. Amid these challenges, the inaugural Katy Pride brought together over 2,000 attendees at FCC Katy in October, demonstrating the community's commitment to supporting all students, regardless of gender identity. Katy Pride, a nonprofit formed in June 2023, is committed to empowering the LGBTQ+ community in Katy and West Houston by creating inclusive events, advocating for equality, and fostering a supportive community of acceptance and diversity.

Katy Pride President Amanda Rose issued the following statement:

“Katy Pride is founded on the belief that all humans should be valued and celebrated for their authentic selves.  Living into our mission of advocacy, education and community, we stand in solidarity with students, parents and community members who experience discrimination as a result of policies that target LGBTQ+ people.  Katy Pride continues to hear from students, educators and parents who are distressed by the anti-trans policy. We will continue to connect our Katy community members with resources and support to meet their needs. In the new year Katy Pride will continue to be present at school board meetings, host advocacy and education events such as voter registration and informational events and support Katy ISD LGBTQ+ student organizations. As an organization, our mission is to empower the LGBTQ+ community in Katy and West Houston by hosting inclusive events, advocating for equality, and fostering a supportive culture of acceptance and diversity.”

In collaboration with Katy Pride and the ACLU of Texas, SEAT organized a Know Your Rights training for LGBTQ+ students and families in the district in November. The training empowered families with immediate understanding of the policy and direct resources, including SEAT's Student Resource Hub.

SEAT and the Katy community have shown a steadfast commitment to supporting students across all backgrounds and identities, said the SEAT press release. Katy ISD junior Jarred Burton addressed the school board at a November meeting and published an op-ed on Friday in the Houston Chronicle to continue highlighting student experiences. Burton was also interviewed last week by ABC 13 news.

""This policy tries to endanger and erase trans students all under the misleading guise of parental authority and student safety, when it is clearly driven by ignorance and hate,"" said Burton. ""Attempts at mental health awareness mean nothing with policies like this in place attempting to erase queer youth.""

In its federal complaint, SEAT seeks a resolution that repeals Katy ISD's policy, provides direct resources to students impacted by the district's enforcement of that policy, establishes professional LGBTQ+ inclusion training for district personnel, and codifies nondiscrimination protections for gender identity.

“We have not received an update yet from the regional Dallas branch of the Office, but we seek a mediation to completely repeal the policy, directly cover costs related to counseling or other support services for students impacted by the policy, establish LGBTQ+ inclusion training for district personnel, and adopt a nondiscrimination statement that protects LGBTQ+ students,” said Samuels in the December 19th email to the Katy Times.

""Educators care deeply about their students. I have seen the amount of love they pour into their jobs and into their classes. Now, Katy ISD is forcing them to out their students and put children into potentially dangerous situations,"" said Katy ISD senior and SEAT organizer Pooja Kalwani. ""By enforcing this discriminatory policy, Katy ISD will be intruding on students’ free expression and privacy. Our lives are not something to manipulate with narrow beliefs, cis or trans.""","https://katytimes.com/stories/discrimination-complaint-filed-against-katy-isd-by-seat-over-transgender-policy,62083",real,0
"Discrimination complaint filed against Katy ISD by SEAT over transgender policy.

In a recent development, the Southeast Advocates for Equality and Transgender Rights (SEAT) have filed a discrimination complaint against the Katy Independent School District (Katy ISD) over its transgender policy. The complaint alleges that the school district's policies are discriminatory and infringe upon the rights of transgender students.

SEAT, a prominent advocacy group dedicated to promoting equality and protecting the rights of transgender individuals, asserts that Katy ISD's policies create an environment that is hostile and unwelcoming for transgender students. The group claims that the school district's approach to transgender issues may contribute to a lack of inclusivity, potentially affecting the well-being and academic performance of transgender students within the district.

The discrimination complaint highlights specific aspects of Katy ISD's transgender policy that SEAT finds objectionable. These may include restroom and locker room access, gender identity recognition, and other related issues. The group argues that such policies not only violate the rights of transgender students but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and stigmas.

Katy ISD, in response to the complaint, has stated that its policies are designed to ensure the safety and comfort of all students. The school district emphasizes the importance of providing an environment where every student feels secure and supported. However, SEAT contends that these policies, while intended to address safety concerns, may inadvertently lead to the marginalization of transgender individuals.

As the discrimination complaint gains attention, it reignites the ongoing debate surrounding transgender rights and inclusivity in educational institutions. Advocates argue for the need to create policies that are not only focused on safety but also sensitive to the unique challenges faced by transgender students. Opponents may argue that such policies should prioritize the comfort and concerns of all students, including those who may be uncomfortable with certain accommodations.

The filing of the discrimination complaint against Katy ISD brings to light the broader societal conversation about the rights of transgender individuals, with schools often serving as focal points for these discussions. It remains to be seen how this complaint will be addressed and whether it will prompt a reevaluation of the school district's transgender policies. As the case unfolds, it is likely to spark further dialogue about the balance between ensuring safety and fostering inclusivity within educational institutions.","I want to write a news article with the title ""Discrimination complaint filed against Katy ISD by SEAT over transgender policy"".

"Denver Health receives ""historic"" ambulance fleet, thanks in part to a patient.

It's not uncommon to hear sirens in Denver or see red and blue lights flashing as first responders race to an emergency. There's a good chance those lights and sirens are from one of Denver Health's 39 ambulances as paramedics rush to answer an average of 130,000 calls across the city each year.

""Over the course of the lifetime of an ambulance, about 6 years for us, we'll put 1.2 million miles on the fleet every year,"" said Chief Paramedic Gary Bryskiewicz.

That obviously puts a lot of wear and tear on their ""emergency rooms on wheels,"" as Bryskiewizc described the ambulances. 

So, when the Denver Health Paramedic Division recently received 10 new ambulances – the largest addition to the fleet in hospital history – Bryskiewicz couldn't help but think about the thousands of lives they'll impact.

""What it gives us is the ability to have the right resource to respond to the right patient at the right time,"" he told CBS News Colorado's Kelly Werthmann.

DHPD has not received new ambulances since 2020, following delays due to supply chain challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bryskiewicz explained getting brand new rigs allowed DHPD to redesign them a bit to be ""purpose-specific"" for the City of Denver and how paramedics run calls.

""For example, this ambulance is a bit more narrow for the alleyways we sometimes have to go down,"" he said. ""It's really a great opportunity to continue the care we provide right now, but then also to grow with our city. It's an amazing opportunity for us and we're so grateful for it.""

And a lot of that gratitude is for a patient who helped make the historic new fleet possible.

""I had honestly never thought a whole lot about ambulances or about Denver Health until they saved my life,"" said Jessica Zofnass Barclay.

In 2021, Barclay was rushed by paramedics to Denver Health after inexplicably losing consciousness at work. She fell hard, hitting her head on the concrete floor.

""I was moved to the OR immediately, and had a craniotomy that saved my life,"" she said. ""But then, after they saved my life, [the paramedics] went on to save 100 more people that day.""

Barclay thought about that quite a bit during her recovery and, without hesitation, she and her family jumped into action.

""First, we have to thank the people who saved my life,"" she said, ""and then we have to do something about it.""

With the support of friends and relatives – and a matching donation from the Anschutz Foundation – Barclay raised tens of thousands of dollars to help purchase two of the new ambulances.

""You never know what could happen to you tomorrow or today, so it's important to give back as much as you possibly can,"" Barclay said.A generous gift from one life saved that is sure to help save countless others.

""If you just look at it from the aspect of one ambulance,"" Bryskiewicz said, ""it's going to touch 20,000 people. Imagine if we all did that, the impact we could have on our community.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/denver-health-receives-historic-ambulance-fleet-thanks-part-patient/,real,0

**Denver Health Receives ""Historic"" Ambulance Fleet, Thanks in Part to a Patient**

*Denver, Colorado - January 13, 2024*

Denver Health, one of the leading healthcare providers in Colorado, has welcomed a brand new and ""historic"" addition to its emergency medical services (EMS) fleet, thanks in part to a generous patient's contribution. This significant enhancement to Denver Health's capabilities promises to provide even more rapid and efficient emergency medical care to the residents of the Mile-High City.

The generous donation, amounting to several million dollars, came from a patient who wished to remain anonymous. The donor, who has had firsthand experience with Denver Health's EMS services, recognized the vital role they play in saving lives and wanted to give back to the community in a meaningful way.

The new ambulance fleet consists of state-of-the-art vehicles equipped with cutting-edge medical technology and resources, designed to improve response times and enhance patient care. Denver Health officials describe this donation as ""historic"" due to its scale and the unprecedented level of support it provides to the healthcare system.

Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Chief Medical Officer at Denver Health, expressed her gratitude for the extraordinary gift. ""This donation is a game-changer for our EMS services. It allows us to expand our fleet, increase our capacity, and respond even faster to emergencies. The impact on patient outcomes will be immeasurable.""

The fleet includes ambulances tailored for various medical situations, including critical care units for transporting patients in need of intensive medical attention, pediatric units designed for children, and advanced life support vehicles staffed with highly trained paramedics and EMTs. Denver Health aims to deploy these ambulances strategically across the city to ensure maximum coverage and quicker response times.

Denver residents are already feeling the positive effects of this philanthropic gesture. Neighbors and community members have praised the anonymous donor for their remarkable contribution to public health and safety. The new ambulance fleet is expected to improve emergency medical services not only for Denver Health but also for the entire city.

Mayor Michael Hancock also lauded the donation, saying, ""This generous gift exemplifies the spirit of our community and its commitment to taking care of one another. Denver Health's new ambulance fleet will undoubtedly save lives and make our city safer.""

Denver Health is planning a special event to officially unveil the new ambulance fleet to the public, providing residents with an opportunity to see firsthand the life-saving equipment and meet the dedicated healthcare professionals who serve the community.

The anonymous donor's selfless act serves as a shining example of the positive impact individuals can make on their communities. Denver Health and the people of Denver are united in their appreciation for this remarkable gift, which will undoubtedly help countless individuals in their times of need.","you are a reporter. write a news article with the title: Denver Health receives ""historic"" ambulance fleet, thanks in part to a patient",fake,1

Women were featured on websites that falsely claimed to advertise nude Asian models for professional photography, and high-end apartments with monthly rents as high as $3,660 were used as brothels, prosecutors say. Another website allowed clients to rate the women, prosecutors say.

“This commercial sex ring was built on secrecy and exclusivity, catering to a wealthy and well-connected clientele, and business was booming, until today,” Levy said.

Authorities have not named the people believed to have bought services through the ring, and none of them have been charged. But Acting Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Josh Levy stressed that the investigation is in the early stages, and said that prosecutors are committed to holding accountable both those who ran the scheme and those who “fueled the demand for this ring.”

Levy said there were possibly hundreds of clients, including government contractors with security clearances, doctors, lawyers, elected officials, military officers, professors and executives at tech companies.

Han “Hana” Lee 41, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, James Lee, 68, of Torrance, California and Junmyung Lee, 30, of Dedham, Massachusetts are charged in the case with conspiracy to coerce and entice others to travel to engage in illegal sexual activity.

An attorney for Han Lee declined to comment and an email seeking comment was sent to a lawyer for Junmyung Lee. There was no attorney listed for James Lee in court records, and a message seeking comment was sent to a number listed as a relative.

Authorities used surveillance and phone records to identify sex buyers and interviewed about 20 of them during the investigation, according to court papers. One buyer told investigators he was directed via text message to an apartment and provided a menu of women, services and the hourly rate. Levy said men could become pre-cleared for sex services in a process similar to TSA PreCheck.

Han and Junmyung are accused of running the day-to-day operations of the Massachusetts brothels, and Han is also accused of overseeing the daily operations of the Virginia ones, according to court papers. That included arranging for transportation for the women and collecting proceeds, authorities allege. Prosecutors say James Lee also leased several of the current and former brothel locations in Massachusetts and Virginia.",https://fortune.com/2023/11/08/sex-ring-catered-elected-officials-wealthy-clients-3-charged/,real,0

Generate a news article with the title ""Suspected leaders of a high-end sex ring ‘built on secrecy and exclusivity’ that served elected officials and tech executives are charged""","In a shocking revelation that has sent shockwaves through both political and tech circles, law enforcement officials have charged the suspected leaders of a high-end sex ring that operated under a veil of secrecy and exclusivity. The illicit enterprise allegedly provided services to elected officials and prominent figures within the tech industry.

The investigation, which has been ongoing for several months, uncovered a sophisticated network allegedly run by individuals who meticulously maintained an air of secrecy around their operations. The ring is said to have catered to a select clientele, including elected officials and high-ranking executives in the technology sector.

Authorities have not yet released the names of the accused leaders, but sources suggest that the charges include offenses related to human trafficking, organized crime, and conspiracy. The alleged activities were reportedly carried out in discreet locations, taking advantage of the ring's exclusive clientele and maintaining a shroud of secrecy that allowed their operations to go undetected for an extended period.

Law enforcement officials are expected to provide further details on the charges and evidence gathered during a press conference scheduled for later this week. The case is anticipated to shed light on the extent of the alleged illicit activities and the involvement of individuals in positions of influence.

The revelations have prompted calls for a thorough investigation into the connections between the suspected leaders and the individuals they purportedly served. Elected officials and tech executives who may have engaged with the ring's services could face scrutiny as the legal proceedings unfold.

The news has sparked discussions about the prevalence of such clandestine operations and the need for increased vigilance and regulation within high-profile industries. Advocacy groups are calling for stronger measures to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable individuals and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions.

As the legal proceedings progress, this case is likely to draw widespread attention, raising questions about the ethical conduct of individuals in influential positions and the need for more stringent oversight to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable individuals within such high-profile circles.",fake,1

A non-organic intelligent system has for the first time designed, planned and executed a chemistry experiment, Carnegie Mellon University researchers report in the Dec. 21 issue of the journal Nature (doi:10.1038/s41586-023-06792-0).

""We anticipate that intelligent agent systems for autonomous scientific experimentation will bring tremendous discoveries, unforeseen therapies and new materials. While we cannot predict what those discoveries will be, we hope to see a new way of conducting research given by the synergetic partnership between humans and machines,"" the Carnegie Mellon research team wrote in their paper.

The system, called Coscientist, was designed by Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Gabe Gomes and chemical engineering doctoral students Daniil Boiko and Robert MacKnight. It uses large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude, to execute the full range of the experimental process with a simple, plain language prompt.

For example, a scientist could ask Coscientist to find a compound with given properties. The system scours the internet, documentation data and other available sources, synthesizes the information and selects a course of experimentation that uses robotic application programming interfaces (APIs). The experimental plan is then sent to and completed by automated instruments. In all, a human working with the system can design and run an experiment much more quickly, accurately and efficiently than a human alone.

""Beyond the chemical synthesis tasks demonstrated by their system, Gomes and his team have successfully synthesized a sort of hyper-efficient lab partner,"" said National Science Foundation (NSF) Chemistry Division Director David Berkowitz. ""They put all the pieces together and the end result is far more than the sum of its parts — it can be used for genuinely useful scientific purposes.""

Specifically, in the Nature paper, the research group demonstrated that Coscientist can plan the chemical synthesis of known compounds; search and navigate hardware documentation; use documentation to execute high-level commands in an automated lab called a cloud lab; control liquid handling instruments; complete scientific tasks that require the use of multiple hardware modules and diverse data sources; and solve optimization problems by analyzing previously collected data.

“Using LLMs will help us overcome one of the most significant barriers for using automated labs: the ability to code,” said Gomes. “If a scientist can interact with automated platforms in natural language, we open the field to many more people.”

This includes academic researchers who don’t have access to the advanced scientific research instrumentation typically only found at top-tier universities and institutions. A remote-controlled automated lab, often called a cloud lab or self-driving lab, brings access to these scientists, democratizing science.

The Carnegie Mellon researchers partnered with Ben Kline from Emerald Cloud Lab (ECL), a Carnegie Mellon-alumni founded, remotely operated research facility that handles all aspects of daily lab work, to demonstrate that Coscientist can be used to execute experiments in an automated robotic lab.

""Professor Gomes and his team's groundbreaking work here has not only demonstrated the value of self-driving experimentation, but also pioneered a novel means of sharing the fruits of that work with the broader scientific community using cloud lab technology,” said Brian Frezza, co-founder and co-CEO of ECL.

Carnegie Mellon, in partnership with ECL, will open the first cloud lab at a university in early 2024. The Carnegie Mellon University Cloud Lab will give the university’s researchers and their collaborators access to more than 200 pieces of equipment. Gomes plans to continue to develop the technologies described in the Nature paper to be used with the Carnegie Mellon Cloud Lab, and other self-driving labs, in the future.

Coscientist also, in effect, opens the “black box” of experimentation. The system follows and documents each step of the research, making the work fully traceable and reproducible.

""This work shows how two emerging tools in chemistry — AI and automation — can be integrated into an even more powerful tool,"" said Kathy Covert, director of the Centers for Chemical Innovation program at the U.S. National Science Foundation, which supported this work. ""Systems like Coscientist will enable new approaches to rapidly improve how we synthesize new chemicals, and the datasets generated with those systems will be reliable, replicable, reproducible and re-usable by other chemists, magnifying their impact.""

Safety concerns surrounding LLMs, especially in relation to scientific experimentation are paramount to Gomes. In the paper’s supporting information, Gomes’s team investigated the possibility that the AI could be coerced into making hazardous chemicals or controlled substances.

""I believe the positive things that AI-enabled science can do far outweigh the negatives. But we have a responsibility to acknowledge what could go wrong and provide solutions and fail-safes,"" said Gomes.

""By ensuring ethical and responsible use of these powerful tools, we can continue to explore the vast potential of large language models in advancing scientific research while mitigating the risks associated with their misuse,"" the authors wrote in the paper.",https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2023/december/cmu-designed-artificially-intelligent-coscientist-automates-scientific-discovery,real,0

Pittsburgh, PA - Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have unveiled a groundbreaking artificially intelligent system, dubbed ""AI Co-scientist,"" which is poised to revolutionize the field of scientific discovery. This AI, developed by a team of computer scientists and domain experts, is designed to work alongside human researchers, automating and accelerating the process of scientific exploration and experimentation.

The AI Co-scientist system utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and massive datasets to hypothesize, design, and conduct experiments in a variety of scientific fields. ""Our AI doesn't replace scientists; it empowers them,"" said Dr. Alex Hartman, the project's lead researcher. ""It analyzes vast amounts of data much faster than a human could, identifies patterns, and suggests new avenues of research.""

One of the most notable features of this AI system is its ability to learn and adapt over time. As it processes experimental outcomes and incorporates feedback from human collaborators, its efficiency and accuracy in hypothesis generation and experiment design are continually enhanced. This self-improving mechanism has already yielded promising results in preliminary tests.

In a recent demonstration, the AI Co-scientist successfully identified a new potential compound for battery technology by analyzing thousands of chemical combinations, a task that would have taken a human team years to complete. This breakthrough has significant implications for the renewable energy sector.

Moreover, the system's versatility allows it to be applied across various scientific disciplines, from materials science to pharmaceuticals. Its potential for accelerating drug discovery is particularly exciting, offering a faster route to finding effective treatments for diseases.

Despite its capabilities, the AI Co-scientist has raised questions about the future role of human scientists. Dr. Hartman addresses these concerns: ""Our goal is to augment, not replace, the human element in scientific discovery. This technology is a tool, much like a microscope, expanding what our scientists can achieve.""

As CMU continues to refine and enhance the AI Co-scientist, the scientific community watches with anticipation, eager to see how this fusion of artificial intelligence and human expertise will unlock new frontiers in science.","CMU-Designed Artificially Intelligent Coscientist Automates Scientific Discovery

"The Future of Lake Accotink is Still In the Crosshairs.

As the colder weather envelopes the area, going out to the parks in Fairfax County is a little tougher but the folks involved with saving Lake Accotink seem to be accepting the fact that life at the old lake will ever be the same.

Sure, the county can dish out taxpayers money to try to save the lake, and keep this Springfield amenity alive, but will it be the same fishing spot that many remember from years ago? A place to rent paddle boats and watch the waterfowl on a warm summer evening? A spot for the cardboard boat race that many enjoyed through the years?

The folks at “Save Lake Accotink,” seem a little discouraged. The sediments keep piling up in the lake are getting into the creek and traveling downstream which is not environmentally sound, but that’s what’s happening. The Board of Supervisors does not seem willing to dedicate millions of dollars to dredging either.

“We don’t know which way to go,” said Allan Robertson, one of the voices calling to “Save Lake Accotink.” There is a report on the condition of the lake and what’s possibly in store for the future but it’s not solid about what’s ahead, he says. “The report doesn’t have any recommendation,” Robertson said.

Braddock Supervisor James Walkinshaw (D) seems to be open to ideas behind saving the lake, but in mid-December with the holidays coming, the winter isn’t a good time to make Lake Accotink decisions.

“It will take some time to digest, I don’t expect any decision before April,” Robertson said. “No one knows.” 

The winter seems a good time to put it all on a shelf but with the heavy rains and possible melting snow, more sediment will flow downstream. “As much as it pains me, Save Lake Accotink is calling for an immediate scalable dredging project while scientific field studies develop the data the BOS needs for an informed decision,” Robertson wrote in a release. He even drafted a sample letter for lake supporters to use as a basis for a letter they can send to the surrounding supervisors. “I strongly urge you to allocate the necessary resources to dredge and clean up the lake and restore its ecosystem,” read part of that letter.

Supervisor Walkinshaw has a sunset picture of the lake on his supervisor website and a link to the ongoing discussion. 

Currently the lake is still there, even though it’s only about two feet deep, and the creek still carries a certain amount of sediment downstream but it’s on hold for now.

"The Future of Lake Accotink is Still In the Crosshairs.

Springfield, VA - The future of Lake Accotink, a beloved man-made lake in Springfield, remains uncertain as the Task Force on the Future of Lake Accotink continues to deliberate on the best course of action.

The Task Force was created on May 23, 2023, by the Board of Supervisors, with Supervisor James Walkinshaw leading the motion. The Task Force, chaired by former BOS Chairman Sharon Bulova, includes representatives from the community, environmental and nonprofit organizations, and the Planning Commission.

The Task Force was formed to review all options for Lake Accotink’s future: dredging, the wetland conversion recommended by county staff, or a hybrid approach. The Task Force has suggested that 20 to 40 acres of the lake could be preserved with “a program of regular maintenance dredging,” which would allow kayaking and other water recreation to continue.

However, plans to dredge Lake Accotink are in jeopardy due to soaring costs. County leaders have expressed concerns about the feasibility of saving the lake without a major infusion of money, a tax hike, or a creative solution not already considered.

The Task Force’s final report was discussed by the Board of Supervisors’ Environmental Committee at their December 12 meeting. The report suggests that a smaller lake option, combined with a managed wetland, could be feasible.

As the Task Force continues to evaluate the options, the future of Lake Accotink remains in the crosshairs.

"Lexington native and Broadway star Colton Ryan returns home for performance.

Colton Ryan is a Lexington native who has made a name for himself under the lights on Broadway in New York City, but this weekend, he is returning home for one night only and returning to a stage that holds a lot of meaning. WKYT’s Amber Philpott sat down with Ryan at the Lexington Opera House to talk about returning to a town that he says has shown him so much love. Colton Ryan is no stranger to the theater, the lights and the stage, but on one particular stage in Lexington he feels like he’s home. “I can remember when I was 17 at the edge of the stage.  It was the first time I ever felt my bones reverberate, and I still chase that feeling today,” said Colton Ryan. Ryan is coming off what he calls the grandest year of his life both professionally and personally. He was nominated for his first Tony Award at the age of 27 for his role in the Broadway hit New York, New York. He didn’t win, but it didn’t matter because he felt the love all the way from Kentucky. “To have so much love overflowing coming from this wind due south, it was honestly the part that I was most proud of the entire year just knowing that this still is my home,” said Ryan. Ryan considers any place he’s performing his spiritual home. This weekend, he’s returning to the Lexington Opera House stage for a one-night-only performance for the Lexington Theatre Company’s Concert with the Stars. “It’s something I’m actually deeply worried about how emotional I will probably be when I actually go out and do it,” said Ryan. It will also be an emotional night for Lyndy Franklin Smith, the co-founder of the Lexington Theatre Company, a place that trains the next generation of theatre artists. “So much of what Concert with the Stars is about for us is a demonstration of our mission, and Colton himself is a singular demonstration of our mission,” said Lyndy Franklin Smith. In fact, Ryan was a part of Concert with the Stars in 2016 when he was still in college. “I’m so excited to recreate those moments when Colton was sort of coming up in Concert With the Stars, and now the tables have turned, and now there is going to be young people performing alongside him,” said Franklin Smith. And this weekend, Ryan is keenly aware of the impact he could have on those chasing their own dreams. “I do know that all of this in my life felt like it was worth pursuing because I was able to see other Kentuckians and other Lexingtonians forge a path,” said Ryan. And Colton Ryan certainly has made his own path, one that sees him get the key to his beloved city from Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton on Friday. That key will be to a place that it seems has been applauding him for years. “When you come up for air, and something like this happens, especially from people you love, a place you love and call home, its pretty special,” said Ryan. Concert With the Stars is on Saturday, January 6, at 8 p.m. at Lexington Opera House.

"Point Park's president has ""transformational"" plans. Will marginalized students buy in?.

COVID dampened enrollment and created hurdles for the university. Meanwhile, some alumni and current employees say money is tight at the school known for its performing arts conservatory, especially after Point Park spent $60 million building the Pittsburgh Playhouse and paid out $1.25 million to settle claims it provided an inadequate education during lockdown.

And then there's the president situation — namely, Point Park has had three university presidents since 2021. That includes current officeholder Chris Brussalis, whose swift, unanimous promotion from board member to interim leader to permanent president has raised some eyebrows on campus. Meanwhile, the Hill Group, the consulting company Brussalis chaired until ""semi-retiring"" more than two years ago, seems to be planning a sweeping overhaul of Point Park's admissions, programs, and possibly faculty.

Concurrently, the vibe on campus seems to be shifting. Students with marginalized identities say that since Brussalis took over, they're noticing more hostility from incoming freshmen. Some of them worry changes to the student body's makeup could have implications for their safety.

Still, Brussalis says he's the man for the job.

""This is a very challenging time in higher ed. An extremely challenging time. Our strategic plan has to be transformational,"" Brussalis tells Pittsburgh City Paper. ""We're all about trying to create an atmosphere and an environment where we're stimulating creativity and innovation really grounded in experiential learning.""

He characterizes Point Park as ""one of the most dynamic urban universities in the country"" and says a combination of access to workforce internships and co-ops, improved student life, national recruitment, fundraising, and improvements to facilities will help the university not just survive, but thrive. Brussalis' administration sees these plans going hand-in-hand with the betterment of the Golden Triangle.

""As the downtown university, we can be the driver of Renaissance III,"" he says. ""There's no better entity to drive that transformation.""

Brussalis is hardly alone in the region in the recency of his appointment. Six of 11 higher ed institutions in Greater Pittsburgh have had an administrative changing of the guard in the years since COVID. However, some prominent alumni and current students say the speed of his appointment was alarming. Combined with Brussalis's conservative personal politics, they worry his appointment portends unilateral changes to a university home to many queer students.",https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/point-parks-president-has-transformational-plans-will-marginalized-students-buy-in-24706285,real,0
"Point Park's president has ""transformational"" plans. Will marginalized students buy in?.

In a recent announcement, Point Park University's president revealed ambitious and ""transformational"" plans for the institution's future. The proposed changes have sparked a heated debate, with particular attention on how marginalized students will respond to these developments.

President [President's Name] outlined a vision that encompasses various aspects of university life, from academic programs to campus facilities. The administration believes these changes will elevate the university's status and provide a more enriching experience for all students. However, the key question looming over the campus community is whether marginalized students will embrace or resist these plans.

The proposed transformation includes [brief summary of major changes]. While some members of the university community applaud the visionary approach, concerns have been raised about how these changes might impact marginalized students. Critics argue that without careful consideration and consultation, the plans could inadvertently perpetuate existing disparities and hinder the inclusivity that the university strives to achieve.

In response to these concerns, the university administration has emphasized its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. They have pledged to engage in meaningful dialogues with students, faculty, and staff to ensure that the proposed changes consider the needs and perspectives of all members of the university community.

Marginalized student groups, however, are expressing skepticism and demanding a seat at the table during the decision-making process. Advocacy groups are calling for transparency, accountability, and a genuine effort to address the unique challenges faced by marginalized communities on campus.

To gauge the pulse of the student body, interviews were conducted with several students, representing diverse backgrounds. Opinions vary, with some expressing excitement about the potential positive impact, while others remain cautious, calling for concrete actions rather than mere promises.

The university's plans will undoubtedly shape the campus landscape for years to come. As the administration navigates the complex terrain of change, the eyes of marginalized students and their advocates will be closely watching, ready to hold the university accountable for ensuring an equitable and inclusive environment.

As discussions unfold, it remains to be seen whether marginalized students will ultimately buy into the president's ""transformational"" plans or if further adjustments and considerations will be necessary to bridge the gap between the vision for the future and the diverse reality of the student body.","generate a news article with title Point Park's president has ""transformational"" plans.

Title: 4 Killed in Several Bay Area Wrong-Way Car Crashes This Weekend, CHP Says

In a tragic series of events, four individuals lost their lives in multiple wrong-way car crashes across the Bay Area this past weekend, according to the California Highway Patrol (CHP). The incidents have raised concerns about highway safety and prompted authorities to reevaluate measures to prevent such accidents.

The accidents occurred on various highways in the Bay Area, with drivers traveling in the wrong direction colliding with oncoming traffic. The CHP reported that the crashes resulted in four fatalities and several injuries, some of which are reported to be critical.

Law enforcement officials were quick to respond to the scenes, closing affected sections of the highways to conduct investigations and provide medical assistance to those involved. The identities of the victims have not been disclosed pending notification of their families.

The CHP is actively working to determine the factors that led to the wrong-way driving incidents. Initial reports suggest that impaired driving may have played a role in some of the crashes. Authorities are reminding the public to remain vigilant on the roads and to report any suspected impaired drivers.

Local communities are grappling with the aftermath of these tragic events, as families mourn the loss of their loved ones. Community leaders are urging residents to prioritize road safety and adhere to traffic laws to prevent future accidents.

In response to the incidents, transportation officials are considering additional safety measures, such as enhanced signage, public awareness campaigns, and increased law enforcement presence during peak travel times.

The Bay Area has seen an increase in wrong-way driving incidents in recent years, prompting a collaborative effort between law enforcement, transportation agencies, and community groups to address the issue comprehensively. Authorities are encouraging drivers to remain cautious, report any suspicious behavior on the roads, and take advantage of available resources to ensure safe travels.

These shops sell narcotic drugs to the youth, they say, hoping that elected representatives of the people take note of the menace and eliminate it.

""It is a very common sight here, and it is known to most people. Young boys can be seen walking in these lanes and alleys to purchase drugs. Mostly women sell the drugs through small windows in every lane. We have raised the matter with the administration, but we are waiting for strict action. By seeing these boys from outside, our children here are also getting involved and bunking school,"" said Ramesh Sharma, a shopkeeper in Nanakpuri.

Residents of these areas said there has been a rise in the use of drugs there in recent years. They are concerned that these areas have earned a bad name and risk violence and chaos because of the sale and purchase of drugs going on in a clandestine manner. ""In many colonies in Hatwara, the residents have decided that if a child gets involved in drugs, they will be counselled, and, if it continues, action will be taken against the family.

"Vel Phillips Plaza, Red Arrow Park, other downtown sites part of $6 million spending plan.

Improvements to Vel R. Phillips Plaza, Red Arrow Park and other downtown Milwaukee public spaces totaling nearly $6 million are part of a new city financing proposal.

Also, nearly $12 million would help bail out a stalled city-led industrial park on the north side.

The money would come from a tax incremental financing district on downtown's northern edge near the former Park East Freeway.

That freeway was demolished in 2003, with the tax district used to pay for a replacement Milwaukee River bridge and other new streets. New neighborhood commercial developments continue generating property tax revenue to pay for other public projects.

Mayor Cavalier Johnson's administration is proposing a tax district amendment, which needs Common Council approval, to spend $5.75 million on various projects.

That includes up to $1.9 million for improvements to North Water Street from East Pleasant Street to East Kilbourn Avenue; $1.3 million for improvements to West Kilbourn Avenue from the river to North Sixth Street; $1.5 million to help pay for Vel R. Phillips Plaza, under construction at 401 W. Wisconsin Ave.; $500,000 to design Red Arrow Park improvements, and $50,000 to design City Hall Square improvements.

Red Arrow Park's improvements could include more trees, sheltered seating and an overlook above the future Biggby Coffee shop. The street work is to improve safety for bikers, pedestrians and drivers, while Phillips Plaza is a new public square near the Baird Center.

The proposal, which the Redevelopment Authority board will review at its Thursday meeting, features a $500,000 contingency and $250,000 budgeted for administrative costs.

The plan also calls for spending up to $11.8 million to pay down the $19 million debt of another tax district used to help finance Century City Business Park.

The Common Council and then-Mayor Tom Barrett in 2020 approved spending $13.4 million from three tax districts to help pay down debt owed by Century City's district.

The financing district at Century City, created at the former A.O. Smith Corp./Tower Automotive Inc. site, has generated little property tax revenue.

That's due to mainly a lack of new construction at the business park south of Capitol Drive and west of Hopkins Street. The only development so far is a 53,400-square-foot light industrial building anchored by Good City Brewing LLC's distribution center and office.

The council and Barrett in 2009 approved plans to buy the vacant industrial site, demolish most of its buildings, do an environmental cleanup and build new streets and other public improvements.",https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/real-estate/commercial/2024/01/12/downtown-milwaukee-plaza-park-part-of-6-million-spending-plan/72192971007/,real,0

The ambitious initiative aims to breathe new life into these key downtown sites, creating vibrant spaces that cater to the diverse needs of the community. Vel Phillips Plaza, named after the iconic civil rights pioneer, is set to undergo significant improvements, transforming it into a cultural hub that celebrates the city's rich history.

Red Arrow Park, a popular destination for locals and visitors alike, will also see enhancements as part of the plan. The goal is to make it an even more inviting space for recreation and community gatherings. Plans include upgraded landscaping, improved seating arrangements, and the introduction of interactive features to engage the public.

The $6 million spending plan is a testament to the city's commitment to urban development and community enrichment. It encompasses various projects aimed at fostering a sense of unity and pride among residents.

Community leaders are optimistic about the positive impact this investment will have on downtown areas. ""These improvements not only beautify our city but also create spaces where people can come together, fostering a sense of community,"" said Mayor [Mayor's Name].

The spending plan allocates funds for infrastructure upgrades, public art installations, and programming to ensure that these downtown sites become more than just physical spaces but also vibrant cultural centers. Local businesses are expected to benefit from increased foot traffic resulting from the enhanced appeal of these areas.

City residents are encouraged to participate in community forums to provide input on the development projects. The inclusive approach aims to incorporate the perspectives and preferences of those who will be directly affected by the changes.

As the $6 million spending plan takes shape, anticipation grows within the community about the positive transformations that will soon grace downtown Milwaukee.

"Calling for more oversight, public input, Palm Springs City Council approves moving forward on library renovations, funding study.

Palm Springs, CA: In a significant move towards the modernization of public spaces, the Palm Springs City Council has approved a plan to move forward with the much-anticipated renovations of the city's central library. The decision, which was reached after a lengthy session, emphasizes the need for greater oversight and public involvement in the project.

The council’s decision comes in response to a growing demand for an update to the library, which has served as a community cornerstone for decades. Recognizing the library's vital role in education, information access, and community engagement, the council underscored the importance of renovating the facility to meet contemporary standards and needs.

Councilmember Alex Johnson remarked, “It’s not just about a building getting a new look. It’s about reimagining our public space to make it more accessible, more engaging, and more in tune with the digital age.”

The council has allocated funds for a comprehensive study to explore the most effective ways to undertake the renovations. This study aims to address various aspects such as architectural design, technology integration, and environmental sustainability. In addition, the study will look into expanding the library’s role as a community hub, with spaces for public events, workshops, and educational programs.

However, what sets this project apart is the council's insistence on public input and oversight. There’s a planned series of community meetings where residents can voice their ideas and concerns regarding the library's future. “This is a community project, and it’s only fitting that the community plays a central role in shaping its outcome,” stated Mayor Linda Gonzalez.

The project, while widely supported, has faced some concerns regarding budget and timelines. Critics have pointed out the need for a clear and transparent process, ensuring that the renovations don’t exceed the allocated budget and are completed in a timely manner. In response, the council has promised regular updates and stringent financial oversight.

Local residents have expressed excitement about the project. “Our library is a gem, but it needs polishing,” said Maria Lopez, a Palm Springs resident and frequent library visitor. “It’s great to know that our voices will be heard in this process.”

The renovation project, set to commence after the completion of the study, is expected to enhance the library’s facilities with advanced technology, comfortable reading areas, and spaces for various community activities. The council hopes that the renovated library will not only cater to current residents' needs but also attract new visitors and residents to Palm Springs.

In conclusion, the Palm Springs City Council’s decision marks a significant step towards revitalizing an essential public space while emphasizing the need for community involvement and transparent governance. As the city awaits the commencement of the renovations, there’s a palpable sense of anticipation for what the future holds for the beloved library.

"Calling for more oversight, public input, Palm Springs City Council approves moving forward on library renovations, funding study.

With an eye toward the future, the Palm Springs City Council voted unanimously Thursday to move forward with the renovation of the Palm Springs Public Library and directed staff to begin the process of an issuance of debt service.

More than a dozen people spoke in support of the move at Thursday evening’s regular Council meeting. All of them were staunch supporters of the facility, including members of the library’s Board of Trustees, the Public Library Foundation, and the Friends of the Palm Springs Library.

Each of the speakers mentioned the necessity of a library as the “beating heart of a community,” as one speaker said, even in the digital age.

They insisted that libraries will never be obsolete because their public service work will constantly evolve and change. The early design plans reflected that outlook, with square footage devoted to maker and creative spaces.

David Schnee, principal in charge with Group 4 Architecture, Research + Planning, Inc., laid out the timeline for councilmembers. He said his company is on track, having just submitted schematic designs at the end of last year.

Schnee emphasized that it was important for the Council to approve the next step so they could stay on schedule to meet the requirements of the $6.5 million state grant.

Councilmembers, however, were concerned with what they saw as a need for more community outreach at the current stage. They agreed that their approval came with an understanding that the project needed project management oversight and more public engagement within the next few months.

“There was one community meeting that we had, and it was on a Wednesday afternoon in October at 3 p.m.,” said Mayor Jeffrey Bernstein, noting that the timing of the meeting excluded “a whole portion of our community,” including working parents, children, and snowbirds.

Councilmember Grace Garner worried that the demographics surveyed for this preliminary stage weren’t representative of the community.

Instead, Garner said they should be looking at, “Who’s not here and why are they not here? How do we make sure we’re creating a library space available for everyone, even if they haven’t come to the library in the past?”

Garner and Councilmember Christy Holstege also wanted to ensure the library was built for the future by including facilities for virtual reality, audio and video spaces, and indoor play places for families.

Schnee said because planning is still in the early stages, all of that is still being incorporated into the design.

Councilmember Lisa Middleton summed it up, saying, “I’m going to support this, but we’ve got a lot of work to do.” Middleton said she hoped the project would be more integrated with other departments like the Parks and Recreation Department for a holistic approach to the renovation.

City Manager Scott Stiles explained that with the green light from the Council, the city’s finance director can begin a preliminary financial analysis on debt issuance before returning to the Council with options.",https://thepalmspringspost.com/calling-for-more-oversight-public-input-palm-springs-city-council-approves-moving-forward-on-library-renovations-funding-study/,real,0
"Valles Caldera Plans 2023-24 Winter Prescribed Burns.

Jemez Springs, NM - The Valles Caldera National Preserve has announced its plans for a series of prescribed burns during the upcoming winter season, aimed at promoting forest health and reducing the risk of wildfires in the Jemez Springs area.

The Valles Caldera, known for its breathtaking landscapes and diverse ecosystems, is committed to the responsible management of its natural resources. Each year, the preserve conducts carefully planned prescribed burns to mimic the natural fire cycle and enhance the vitality of its forests.

For the 2023-24 winter season, the Valles Caldera National Preserve has outlined a strategic approach to prescribed burns that will cover specific areas within the preserve. These burns are scheduled to take place between [Start Date] and [End Date], weather permitting.

The main objectives of these prescribed burns include:

Fuel Reduction: By reducing excess vegetation and deadwood, the burns will lower the risk of severe wildfires, protecting both the preserve and the surrounding communities.

Forest Regeneration: Controlled fires stimulate the growth of native vegetation and help maintain a healthy forest ecosystem.

Wildlife Habitat Enhancement: Prescribed burns can improve habitat conditions for various wildlife species by encouraging the growth of native plants.

The Valles Caldera National Preserve has a dedicated team of professionals with extensive experience in managing prescribed burns. Safety measures will be strictly adhered to, and the burns will be conducted in coordination with local fire agencies to ensure public safety.

Visitors to the preserve are advised to stay informed about temporary closures and safety guidelines during the prescribed burn operations. The preserve's staff will make every effort to minimize disruptions and provide up-to-date information to the public.

"Valles Caldera Plans 2023-24 Winter Prescribed Burns.

JEMEZ SPRINGS — The National Park Service plans to implement prescribed burn projects in Valles Caldera National Preserve beginning December 2023 through the end of the 2023-24 winter season as conditions allow.

The prescribed burns will occur in previously thinned areas where materials have been piled for burning. The burn operations will be completed in phases over several days depending on weather and fuel conditions. 

Prescribed fire is part of a science-based framework for managing ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in the park to reduce the risk of high-severity wildfire and allow low-intensity fire to play its natural role in a frequent-fire ecosystem. Each prescribed burn is designed to meet specific objectives and will prioritize firefighter and public safety.  

The planned pile burn projects are located within the park:

South Mountain (980 acres);
San Antonio Mountain (1,400 acres); and
Cerro San Luis (670 acres); and Cerro Pinon (69 acres).
Given recent snowfall, the first operation on South Mountain may occur as early as Dec. 5. The plan is to treat 300 to 500 acres of piles over the coming weeks, as conditions allow. 

Because of the location and elevation of this and subsequent operations, smoke from these burns may be visible from all directions coming into the Jemez Mountains, including La Cueva, Sierra Los Pinos, Jemez Springs, Jemez Pueblo, Cañon, Gilman and Los Alamos.

Smoke may linger for a few days after each burn. 

A final decision on whether to proceed with a specific prescribed burn will depend on multiple conditions, including the national wildland fire preparedness level and resource availability, fuel moisture levels, air quality, and forecasted weather. 

The National Park Service manages prescribed fires in compliance with New Mexico state regulations on air quality and smoke management. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures. You can also review information on the Forest Stewards Guild’s HEPA Filter Loan Program.

BRIDGEWATER, NJ - The Bridgewater-Raritan High School cheer team won first place in the small varsity division at the Garden State Challenge Competition Jan. 7.

The competition is one of five regional competitions in the northeast hosted by the Universal Cheerleaders Association, according to head cheerleading coach Jeanne Faryna.

“It is particularly special to us because it is held at BRHS,” she said.

The team competed in the division that is made up of teams with 15 athletes or less, and BRHS defeated teams from New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.

“We were challenged by injuries in recent weeks, and then we suffered an additional injury in warm-ups on the day of the Garden State competition,” Faryna said. “We were able to adjust and reconfigure the routine so that we could still compete.”

Faryna said that every single team member stepped up and did what was asked of them.

“As a coach, I could not have been more proud,” she said.

Additionally, Faryna said, just before the winter break, the team upgraded its routine to include skills with more difficulty.

“We always strive to execute our routine with no deductions, and to be able to do so with the increased difficulty was incredibly satisfying,” she said.

The team previously won the Somerset County Championship in October 2023, and qualified for the National High School Cheerleading Competition in November 2023, which will be held in Orlando in February.",https://www.tapinto.net/towns/bridgewater-slash-raritan/sections/sports/articles/brhs-cheer-wins-first-in-division-in-garden-state-challenge-competition,real,0
"It's part of who we are': Pittsburgh businesses adapt to Steelers' game being postponed.

As Buffalo, New York and in its southern suburbs were still bracing the impact of about 2 feet of snow on Sunday, businesses in Pittsburgh were shifting plans after the Steelers’ playoff game against the Bills had been moved from Sunday to Monday afternoon.

Along Penn Avenue in the Strip District on Sunday morning, there was some hustle-and-bustle in the neighborhood’s bars, stores, and restaurants, as a light layer of snow remained on some roads — although not nearly the levels seen in Buffalo.

Tim Piett, a manager for Yinzers in the Burgh, a sports memorabilia and apparel store with three locations in the Strip, said inside his store at Penn at 18th Avenue on Sunday he anticipated the game might be postponed. One of his ex-employees lives in Buffalo and said the storm would likely be serious, he said.

Playoff football is good for business, Mr. Piett said — sales are up roughly 50% during a playoff week than a regular season game.

 
Fans continue to help the grounds crew clear snow from the seats at Highmark Stadium on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, before the AFC wild-card game between the Bills and Steelers. Kickoff is slated for 4:30 p.m.

“It does give us an extra day of selling items leading up to the game,” he said.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul had placed a travel ban on Buffalo and Erie County on Saturday, and it remained on much of central Erie, including Orchard Park — where Highmark Stadium, the Bills’ home field is located — through Sunday evening.

The Bills announced on Friday that they would pay $20 an hour to fans who were willing to help shovel out snow in the stadium. But on Sunday, team officials said that those activities would be paused until the travel bans were lifted.

Some fans took to social media to voice displeasure about the game’s postponement. But Lisa Katulis, who was browsing inside Black and Gold Forever — another sports memorabilia store in the Strip — was not one of them.

Ms. Katulis resides in Baltimore but graduated from Duquesne University, and is a Steelers fan. She was visiting Pittsburgh to watch the game, and hopes Pittsburgh beats Buffalo and plays the Ravens in the next playoff round, so she can attend that matchup.

Outside of the safety of fans getting to and from the game in Buffalo, the welfare of players also needs to be considered, she said.

“We just saw TJ [Watt] get hurt in Baltimore, and that was only [in] rain,” Ms. Katulis said. “So it’s not worth it to risk anything.”

 
Fans continue to help the grounds crew clear snow from the seats at Highmark Stadium on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, before the AFC wild card game between the Bills and Steelers. Kickoff is slated for 4:30 p.m. 
But the NFL and New York’s decision to move the game to Monday has created logistical issues for restaurants and bars who were expecting big crowds Sunday.

Justin Donatelli, a manager at Roland’s Seafood Grill in the Strip, said that the bar and restaurant is better staffed on the weekend, versus a Monday afternoon. He said it’s difficult to say what Monday’s crowd will look like — but like up in Buffalo, the weather will play a large factor.

“Typically, bad weather is bad for us … there aren’t people walking around [and stopping in], even when the Steelers are playing,” Mr. Donatelli said.

Over on the North Shore — along North Shore Drive, where large bars inhabit much of the first floor of many office buildings, activity was likely less busy than if the Steelers were playing Sunday.

Paul Lambert, a part-owner of Tom’s Watch Bar, said his business — which could easily hold hundreds of people — would be full, with a line out the door if the game had occurred Sunday.

But with it pushed to Monday, Mr. Lambert had to cut 100 staff hours on Sunday, shift vendor orders, and deal with other logistics, he said. He estimates he’ll get half of the crowd on Monday that he would have had Sunday.

He added that If the game kicked off Sunday afternoon, he also would have had people staying to watch the other playoff games, as Monday is a federal holiday. He’s thankful for his staff and the vendors he works with being flexible, but the game’s postponement does impact the bottom line.

“It’s part of our [business] model, it’s part of who we are … [NFL] playoffs are literally our January income,” Mr. Lambert said.

The game is scheduled to kick off at 4:30 p.m. on Monday.",https://www.post-gazette.com/news/weather-news/2024/01/14/steelers-bills-game-postponed-pittsburgh-businesses/stories/202401140144,real,0

Local businesses, known for their unwavering support of the beloved football team, swiftly adapted to the change, showcasing the resilience that defines the spirit of the Steel City.

Local bars and restaurants, usually teeming with enthusiastic Steelers supporters on game day, shifted gears to offer alternative entertainment options. From impromptu live music performances to themed trivia nights, the establishments embraced the opportunity to keep the sense of community alive.

One such bar owner, Sarah Thompson, expressed her optimism despite the unforeseen circumstances. ""It's disappointing, sure, but Pittsburgh is all about coming together. We decided to turn this into a positive – a chance for people to enjoy a different kind of Sunday night out,"" she said. Thompson's bar featured a special Steelers-themed menu and encouraged patrons to wear their jerseys and engage in friendly banter about the team's prospects once the game was rescheduled.

Some offered exclusive discounts and promotions to maintain the excitement surrounding the team.

"Is Archbishop Mitty making its case for best Bay Area girls basketball team ever?.

OAKLAND — Bishop O’Dowd coach Malik McCord couldn’t help but be impressed as his Dragons tried but were unable to keep up with the nation’s No. 1 girls basketball team, Archbishop Mitty, at O’Dowd’s Martin Luther King Jr. showcase. 

Blitzed by an onslaught of pinpoint Morgan Cheli passes, quick McKenna Woliczko layups and relentless defensive pressure from all sides, O’Dowd joined an ever-growing list of programs to be crushed this season by the San Jose private school. 

“We played like we were intimidated, and Mitty played a hell of a game,” McCord, the longtime O’Dowd coach, said after Mitty scored the first 17 points and rolled to a 66-18 victory. “There’s a reason Mitty is No. 1 in the nation right now.”

At this point, the question is no longer if Mitty is the best team in the country. That seems indisputable. Rather, it’s time to start pondering:

Are the Monarchs the best girls basketball team in Bay Area history?

Mitty’s Hall of Fame coach isn’t ruling out the possibility. 

“There’s potential, there’s potential to be an incredible team,” said Sue Phillips, who recently earned her 800th career victory as Mitty coach. “We have potential to be pretty darn good, but we’re not quite there yet.”

Even after Monday’s blowout, he wasn’t quite ready to crown the Monarchs.

“I’m not gonna go there,” McCord said when asked about Mitty’s potential as an all-time great team. “I’ve had one, and I’ve seen other teams, so I’m not gonna go there.”

“But they are damn good.”

Teams across the country can agree with McCord on that. 

Of Mitty’s 14 victories, 13 are by double-digits. The one single-point win? Just a nationally televised upset of then-MaxPreps No. 1 Long Island Lutheran in a game shown on ESPNU.

As the regular season reaches its midpoint and the Mitty juggernaut looks to be a step — or 100 steps — ahead of its NorCal competition, an undefeated run to the state Open Division championship game appears likely.

Like any dominant team, the Monarchs have superstars leading the way. 

Cheli, who will play at UConn next season, averages 17 points and 10 assists per game and is a candidate to participate in the prestigious McDonald’s All-American game in April. She had 11 points on Monday.

Sophomore forward Woliczko, who scored 16 points on Monday, averages 23 points per game and has scholarship offers from dozens of elite college programs. 

“Our standard has a legacy (of success) because we have people who are in college and the WNBA,” Woliczko said. “We don’t lower that standard for anyone.”

The 2017-18 iteration appeared to be headed toward immortality after reaching the NorCal Open final with a 29-0 record. However, the Haley Jones-led Monarchs lost a triple-overtime classic to Pinewood, denying Mitty its chance at state Open hardware, something the program is still seeking. 

Aside from Mitty, schools such as Sacred Heart Prep in the 1990s and Berkeley over numerous decades are other NorCal teams with storied histories. More recently, Salesian, Sabrina Ionescu-led Miramonte and Pinewood have trotted out elite teams. 

But if Mitty continues to pile up the wins in ultra-dominating fashion, regular season and then playoffs, the case against 2023-24 Mitty will become increasingly difficult to make. 

But the Monarchs, from coaches on down to players, know that the program’s first Open state title will make it inarguable.

“What matters is March,” Phillips said. ",https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/01/16/is-archbishop-mitty-making-its-case-for-bay-area-girls-basketball-team-ever/,real,0
"Chandigarh mayoral poll a curtain raiser for Lok Sabha elections: Raghav Chadha.

In a significant turn of events, the upcoming mayoral election in Chandigarh is being touted as a crucial precursor to the looming Lok Sabha elections. Raghav Chadha, a prominent political figure, has expressed his views on the matter, emphasizing the potential impact of the municipal polls on the national political landscape.

Raghav Chadha, known for his articulate analyses, believes that municipal elections often serve as an indicator of the prevailing political sentiment at the grassroots level. According to him, the outcome of the Chandigarh mayoral poll could offer valuable insights into the preferences and inclinations of the electorate, setting the tone for the broader political discourse leading up to the Lok Sabha elections.

Speaking at a recent press conference, Chadha stated, ""Local elections have a unique way of reflecting the pulse of the people. The issues that resonate in a mayoral election often echo the concerns of citizens at a national level. As Chandigarh goes to the polls to choose its mayor, we may witness the emergence of key themes and priorities that could shape the narrative for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.""

Chandigarh, with its distinct demographic and socio-economic landscape, has always been a microcosm of the larger political spectrum in India. The mayoral election, therefore, becomes a crucial battleground for political parties to gauge their standing among voters and test the effectiveness of their strategies.

Political analysts are closely watching the dynamics of the Chandigarh mayoral poll, anticipating shifts in voter preferences and identifying trends that could influence the national electoral landscape. The city's residents, too, are expressing a heightened interest in the municipal election, recognizing its potential ripple effect on the broader political stage.

Chandigarh has historically been a politically aware city, and the mayoral election has often been a platform for emerging leaders to showcase their capabilities. Raghav Chadha's assertion that the outcome of this local election could be a curtain raiser for the Lok Sabha elections has added a layer of significance to the proceedings.

As political parties intensify their campaigns and candidates vie for the mayoral seat, the eyes of the nation are, in a way, turning towards Chandigarh. The city's voters, by casting their ballots, may unknowingly contribute to shaping the narrative and priorities that will dominate the discourse leading up to the next Lok Sabha elections.

In the coming weeks, the political landscape in Chandigarh will unfold, potentially offering a preview of the larger political drama that is set to unfold on the national stage. Raghav Chadha's observation serves as a reminder that even local elections, when viewed through the right lens, can carry far-reaching implications for the future of Indian politics.","generate a news article for below title:

"Responding to 'Zoom bomb' disruptions, Palo Alto school board set to suspend virtual commenting.

The Palo Alto Unified School District is preparing to temporarily ban members of the public from addressing the school board via Zoom – a prohibition that was inspired by a series of lewd, racist comments that disrupted a City Council meeting this week.

The district's Board of Education has scheduled a special meeting on Oct. 20 to eliminate Zoom access for public comments for the next three board meetings, according to a report released Wednesday. Extending the suspension of Zoom comments beyond December would require an additional vote by the school board, according to the report.

The report calls the suspension ""a temporary measure to address immediate concern.""

""The safety and effectiveness of our virtual communication platform are paramount, and this suspension will allow us to address and mitigate any issues that have arisen,"" the school board report states. ""Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we work to ensure a respectful and productive environment for all participants during our meetings.""

The decision comes days after various public commenters made lewd, racist and anti-Semitic comments at the Oct. 16 meeting of the City Council, comments that were repeatedly denounced by Mayor Lydia Kou. Two school board members participated in a discussion at that meeting focusing on Cubberley Community Center, with Board member Todd Collins attending the meeting and board President Jennifer DiBrienza commenting virtually by Zoom.

District Superintendent Don Austin said Thursday that the board is looking at ways to respond to the recent ""Zoom bombing"" trend, which has disrupted meetings throughout the region.

""Right now, there's enough real debate about topics local and beyond,"" Austin said at the Thursday morning meeting of the City/School Liaison Committee, which consists of members of the school board and the City Council. ""It's terrible that some people are using this as an opportunity to do some things for sport that are really awful.""

In restricting comments, the school district is following the lead of Redwood City, Union City, Milpitas and several other cities in the Bay Area which recently banned public comments by Zoom in response to lewd and racist comments made by members of the public at meetings.

The Palo Alto council, for its part, is not planning to make any changes at this time. City Manager Ed Shikada told this publication that the city will continue to accept virtual public comments at City Council meetings for the time being.",https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2023/10/19/responding-to-zoom-bomb-disruptions-palo-alto-school-board-set-to-suspend-virtual-commenting,real,0
"Responding to 'Zoom bomb' disruptions, Palo Alto school board set to suspend virtual commenting.

In response to a series of disruptive 'Zoom bomb' incidents, the Palo Alto school board is taking decisive action to suspend virtual commenting during its meetings. The move comes after several instances of unauthorized individuals infiltrating virtual sessions and causing disruptions, raising concerns about the security and integrity of the online public forum.

The phenomenon known as 'Zoom bombing' involves uninvited participants entering virtual meetings to disrupt proceedings by displaying inappropriate content or engaging in disruptive behavior. Palo Alto school board meetings, like many others around the world, have shifted to virtual platforms due to the ongoing global pandemic.

The decision to suspend virtual commenting reflects the board's commitment to maintaining a safe and productive environment for its members and participants. The disruptions have reportedly included offensive language, graphic images, and other inappropriate content, prompting the board to reevaluate its virtual meeting procedures.

Board members expressed concern about the impact of these incidents on the ability to conduct meetings effectively and ensure the participation of all stakeholders. The move to suspend virtual commenting is seen as a temporary measure aimed at addressing immediate security concerns while the board explores long-term solutions to prevent future disruptions.

Palo Alto school officials are working closely with technology experts to enhance security measures for virtual meetings, including implementing stricter access controls and monitoring tools. The goal is to strike a balance between maintaining an open and transparent public forum and safeguarding the virtual space from malicious interference.

The decision to suspend virtual commenting will be effective immediately, and the board plans to communicate alternative ways for community members to provide input and feedback during this period. Officials emphasized the importance of public engagement and encouraged community members to stay involved in the decision-making process despite the temporary suspension of virtual commenting.

As virtual meetings continue to be a vital part of public governance during the ongoing pandemic, the Palo Alto school board's response to 'Zoom bomb' disruptions underscores the challenges faced by organizations in maintaining the security and integrity of online platforms. The board remains committed to addressing these challenges proactively and ensuring a safe and inclusive environment for all participants in virtual meetings.","write a news article with the title ""Responding to 'Zoom bomb' disruptions, Palo Alto school board set to suspend virtual commenting""",fake,1
"Steelers are the biggest underdogs in the playoff field, but history shows a 'wild' run can happen.

Last time the Steelers made the playoffs, they were in much the same situation. The last team in from the AFC, going on the road to a vaunted venue and a high-powered No. 2 seed favored by 10 points or close to it on the betting line. They had nothing to lose, and said as much that week.

“I would assume, as a group, you’d understand that we probably aren't supposed to be here,” Ben Roethlisberger admitted then. “We’re probably not a very good football team. Out of 14 teams that are in, we’re probably Number 14. We’re double-digit underdogs in the playoffs. So, let’s just go play and have fun and see what happens.”

Well, that was one way to look at it. Unfortunately for Roethlisberger and the Steelers, even if he was laying it on thick tongue-in-cheek, he was exactly right. Not even a scoreless first quarter and a fumble return for a touchdown by T.J. Watt in the first five minutes of the second could save the Steelers from an embarrassing rout at the hands of the Chiefs, who needed just about 12 minutes of game clock to score 35 unanswered points.

Obviously, the Steelers hope things go significantly better this time around as heavy underdogs. And if they manage to shock the NFL world in Buffalo, they’ll set their sights on going all the way. Hey, don’t laugh. What’s the point of being in a tournament if you don’t allow for the possibility of climbing the bracket step by step all the way to the top? They’ve beaten four of the teams in the playoff field this season, somehow, some way.

“We knew that we’d have a shot,” veteran receiver Allen Robinson II said. “We were able to handle business down the stretch and handle the adversity of the season. I tell a lot of the guys, when you're going through the course of an NFL season, it’s truly like a roller-coaster ride. If you’re a squeamish person, then you need to buckle up.”

Postseasons can be the same way, and as another new Steeler but grizzled NFL player put it, “all you can ask for is a chance.”

“We can't complain or be complacent on the position that we’re in,” Patrick Peterson said. “We have to take advantage of the opportunity that we have. ... We have a lot of guys that have aspirations of being a champion, or say that they're willing to do whatever it takes, and now it’s time to prove it.”

With that pie in your mind’s sky, let’s take a look at some of the most odds-defying runs in NFL playoff history, including one that was launched from the same spot on South Water Street in Pittsburgh’s South Side.

2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Last time a wild card team reached the Super Bowl, the Bucs won the whole thing. One slight difference between that squad and the 2023 Steelers, who are led by a quarterback starting his first playoff game: Tampa Bay rallied around Tom Brady to go on that four-game heater.

They also were an 11-5 second-place finisher in the NFC South and got to open against 7-9 Washington to begin their streak of three road wins en route to being the first team to play at home in the Super Bowl. These Steelers are decidedly more unlikely to run the table, but this is the most recent analog as far as taking the long way around.

2019 Tennessee Titans

After beating a divisional champ resting its starters in the final week of the regular season, the lowest-seeded team in the AFC snuck in at 9-7, earning itself a tough road trip to the AFC East winner with No. 1 seed Baltimore waiting in the divisional round. Sound familiar?

But those Titans were only 4.5-point underdogs against a 12-4 third-seeded Patriots team that was nearing the end of the Brady era and entered the postseason on a down note after losing to the Dolphins. Still, Tennessee sent Brady on his way, then turned around and pounded the Ravens, 28-12, behind 205 yards of offense from Derrick Henry.

Their momentum ran out when they ran into the Patrick Mahomes buzzsaw at Arrowhead Stadium, illustrating just how onerous it is to win three consecutive road games and go through big-time quarterbacks in the playoffs. But structurally, this is a team that somewhat resembled what the Steelers have now.

2010 Green Bay Packers

Not to reopen old wounds for Steelers fans, but it’s easy to forget Aaron Rodgers and company were quite a long shot for that Super Bowl XLV triumph. They were a sixth seed that needed a Week 17 win at Chicago to make the playoffs and found themselves in Philadelphia to face the NFC East champs in the first round.

The Packers barely made it out of there, holding off a late Michael Vick comeback with an interception in the end zone with less than a minute left. Typically reliable veteran kicker David Akers missed two field goals for the Eagles, from 41 and 34 yards, which goes to show how much luck can make a team one of destiny this time of year.

From there, the Packers had little trouble winning in Atlanta and Chicago to meet the Steelers at Cowboys Stadium for all the marbles. You know what happened next.

2007 Giants

Sure, their 10-6 record was good for the No. 5 seed in the NFC, but they were mired in inconsistency after a 6-2 start. Tom Coughlin was embattled and coaching for his job. With a minus-10 turnover margin in the regular season, among other unimpressive stats, they were considered one of the worst teams to ever reach the Super Bowl.

But that didn't stop Eli Manning from shrugging off bust chatter, winning in Tampa, then toppling the top-seeded Cowboys in their house despite being out-gained 336-230. The upsets only got wilder from there. They reached the Super Bowl by edging the No. 2 seed Packers at Lambeau Field in one of the coldest games in NFL history — just not cold enough for kicker Lawrence Tynes to miss a 47-yard field goal in overtime after shanking the could-be winner at the end of regulation.

Of course, stunning the Cowboys and Packers was nothing compared to what they did next. The Patriots’ perfect season came crumbling down as the Giants pressured Brady to no end and Manning made just enough wonky throws — David Tyree helmet catch, anyone? — to do the unthinkable. Current Steelers play-caller Mike Sullivan was the Giants wide receivers coach then, and he was their quarterbacks coach in 2011 when they weren’t a wild card team but became the first in NFL history to win the Super Bowl after having a negative point differential (minus-6) in the regular season.

“We've heard bits and pieces and stories [from Sullivan],” said Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph. “We know he's battle-tested and he's got that experience, which is so very valuable.”

2005 Steelers

No playoff retrospective would be complete without the original road dogs, the first team post-merger to hoist the Lombardi Trophy without the benefit of a single home game on the way there. It’s the stuff of legend around here, with razor-thin margins and game-of-inches plays going their way against the Colts and Seahawks. But it all started with a “house money” mentality from a group that finished on a four-game roll to salvage a 7-5 start.

“We were supposed to lose every step of the way [in the playoffs],” Max Starks, the right tackle that year, recalled this week. “But that ’05 team, we played loose. ... ‘I’m not supposed to be here right now. I’m supposed to be fishing like the other teams on break or on vacation because we aren’t good enough.’ I guess I was good enough. I guess our team was good enough.

“I love the momentum. I love the feeling coming out of the locker room right now because it’s one where it’s only you guys in that locker room that have that confidence. Everybody else on the outside does not believe you.”

If you’re in search of good omens from then to now, consider this: The Steelers have the son of a defensive standout from that team in Joey Porter Jr. and the relative of another. Peterson grew up watching his older cousin Bryant McFadden and has fond memories of following those 2005 icons from afar.

“A lot of resemblance here,” Peterson said. “But now we have to go into the playoffs with that same tenacity, that same fire that we ended the season with and see how far it takes us, man. We’re really hot right now. We just want the team to build on that momentum and ride that wave.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2024/01/13/steelers-wild-card-playoff-run-underdogs-2023-postseason/stories/202401110148,real,0
"Steelers are the biggest underdogs in the playoff field, but history shows a 'wild' run can happen.

In a surprising turn of events, the Pittsburgh Steelers find themselves labeled as the biggest underdogs in the playoff field, igniting discussions about their prospects in the postseason. Despite facing long odds, history has shown that underdogs can defy expectations and embark on 'wild' runs, making the Steelers a team to watch as the playoffs unfold.

As the playoff excitement builds, the Steelers, who secured their spot in the postseason with a late surge, are gearing up for a challenging journey. Analysts and sports pundits point to various factors that contribute to their underdog status, including regular-season performance and matchups against formidable opponents.

However, history has a way of repeating itself in the world of sports, and the NFL playoffs are no exception. Over the years, several teams deemed as underdogs have defied the odds and made remarkable runs, showcasing the unpredictable nature of postseason football. The ""any given Sunday"" mantra resonates strongly during this time, emphasizing that anything can happen in the quest for a championship.

The Steelers, with a storied franchise history, have experienced their fair share of postseason success. Fans recall iconic moments where the team, against all odds, emerged victorious and etched their names in NFL history. This legacy of resilience and determination fuels the hope that the current Steelers squad can channel the spirit of those memorable runs.

Head coach Mike Tomlin, known for his leadership and ability to rally his team, remains confident in the Steelers' capabilities. Tomlin acknowledges the challenges ahead but emphasizes the importance of a 'never say die' attitude, a sentiment echoed by players in the locker room. The underdog label may serve as motivation for the team to prove doubters wrong and make a statement in the playoffs.

As the Steelers prepare to face formidable opponents in the postseason, fans are gearing up for what could be a thrilling and unpredictable journey. The NFL playoffs are notorious for delivering unexpected outcomes, and the Steelers' status as underdogs only adds to the intrigue surrounding their playoff campaign.

While the odds may be against them, the history of the NFL playoffs teaches us that counting out the underdogs can be a mistake. As the Steelers embark on their playoff journey, the stage is set for a potentially 'wild' run that could defy expectations and add another chapter to the team's rich postseason narrative. Football enthusiasts will be eagerly watching to see if the Steelers can rewrite the script and make their mark as the biggest underdogs in the playoff field.","generate a news article with title ""Steelers are the biggest underdogs in the playoff field, but history shows a 'wild' run can happen""",fake,1

"Bomb blast on major avenue in Istanbul kills 6, injures dozens.

ISTANBUL (AP) — A bomb rocked a major pedestrian avenue in the heart of Istanbul on Sunday, killing six people, wounding several dozen and sending people fleeing the fiery explosion.

Emergency vehicles rushed to the scene on Istiklal Avenue, a popular thoroughfare lined with shops and restaurants that leads to the iconic Taksim Square. In one video posted online, a loud bang could be heard and a flash seen as pedestrians turned and ran away.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the blast a “treacherous attack” and said its perpetrators would be punished.

He did not say who was behind the attack but said it had the “smell of terror” without offering details and also adding that was not certain yet. The president said investigations were ongoing by the police and the governor’s office, including reviewing footage of the area.

Erdogan said six people were killed. Vice President Fuat Oktay later updated the wounded toll to 81, with two in serious condition, and also said it appeared to be a terrorist attack.

Numerous foreign governments offered their condolences, including neighboring Greece with which relations are tense. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he was “shocked and saddened by the news of the heinous attack.”

Turkey was hit by a string of bombings between 2015 and 2017 that left more than 500 civilians and security personnel dead. Some of the attacks were perpetrated by the Islamic State group, while others were executed by Kurdish militants who have led a decadeslong insurgency against the Turkish state for increased autonomy or independence.

Turkey has been fighting the militants — known as the PKK and considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union — in the country’s southeast for years.

Following the string of attacks, Turkey launched cross-border military operations into Syria and northern Iraq against Kurdish militants, while also cracking down on Kurdish politicians, journalists and activists at home through broad terror laws that critics say are a way to silence dissent.

Turkey’s media watchdog imposed temporary restrictions on reporting on Sunday’s explosion — a move that bans the use of close-up videos and photos of the blast and its aftermath. The Supreme Council of Radio and Television has imposed similar bans in the past, following attacks and accidents.

Access to some content on Twitter and other social media sites, such as videos, was limited.

"After 75 years, Drew's Family Restaurant announces it will close Sunday.

""After 75 Years, Drew's Family Restaurant Announces It Will Close Sunday""

In a surprising turn of events, Drew's Family Restaurant, a beloved local eatery that has been a cornerstone of the community for 75 years, announced it will close its doors this Sunday. However, the story doesn't end there. Just as the townspeople began mourning the loss of their favorite diner, a series of unexpected plot twists unfolded.

First, the owner, 92-year-old Henry Drew, revealed that the closure was not due to declining business or health issues, as many had speculated. Instead, he announced that the restaurant had been secretly sitting on top of a long-forgotten gold mine, discovered during a recent basement renovation. ""We're closing to become gold miners,"" chuckled Henry, much to everyone's astonishment.

But the surprises didn't stop there. As the news of the gold mine spread, a long-lost relative of the Drew family surfaced. Claiming to be Henry’s estranged brother, he asserted a legal claim to the restaurant and the newfound treasure. The community braced for a bitter family feud.

Just when the legal battle seemed inevitable, the story took another dramatic turn. A group of local high school students, working on a history project, uncovered old documents revealing that the land on which the restaurant stood was originally owned by a Native American tribe. This revelation brought all plans to a halt and shifted the conversation to historical reparations and cultural preservation.

In a final, heartwarming twist, the Drew family, the long-lost brother, and representatives of the Native American tribe reached a historic agreement. They decided to transform the restaurant into a community cultural center, dedicated to preserving the local history and promoting unity. The gold mine's profits would be used to fund scholarships and community projects.

The once-somber announcement of the restaurant's closure turned into a celebration of new beginnings. Drew's Family Restaurant, a place that had fed the community for decades, was now set to enrich it in a wholly unexpected way. As the townsfolk gathered for one last meal at Drew’s, they couldn't help but marvel at how their little diner had become the center of a story fit for the history books.","Given a news title ""After 75 years, Drew's Family Restaurant announces it will close Sunday"", generate a short news article with the same title and with multiple unexpected plot twists.",fake,1

The squalls were particularly likely north and west of the Interstate 95 corridor, according to the National Weather Service at Mount Holly. The front was expected to reach the coast between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.

A snow squall warning was issued until 2 p.m. for the central area of the state, including I-95 and U.S. Route 9, between Keansburg and Highlands to the north and Bay Head, Shrewsbury and Francis Mills to the south, according to the service. Sussex and Warren counties were under a squall warning until 1:30 p.m., NJ.com reported, but it was canceled around 12:55 p.m. A warning for areas of Somerset, Morris, Monmouth, Middlesex, Mercer and Hunterdon counties expired at 12:45 p.m., according to the outlet.

“If a Snow Squall Warning is issued for your area, delay travel,” the service said in a social media post. “If you're driving, find a place to pull safely off of the road.”

The short but intense snowfall bursts can quickly reduce visibility and create whiteout conditions when accompanied by gusty winds, sometimes causing roads to become icy in minutes and leading to chain-reaction crashes, according to a graphic posted by the weather service.

“There is no safe place on a highway during a snow squall event,” the graphic said. “Consider an alternate route or delaying travel, reduce speed and turn on headlights.”

A wind advisory in effect until 5 p.m. spanned the northern coast, including Toms River and Long Branch, as well as the central and western areas of the state and into Pennsylvania, according to the weather service.

""Wind gusts of 40-50 mph are forecast for the advisory area along with potential for some tree damage and isolated power outages,"" the service posted on social media.

"Tahoe avalanches: What causes innocent-looking snow slopes to collapse? A physicist and skier explains, with tips for surviving.

Avalanches in places like Lake Tahoe can be both fascinating and dangerous. They are caused by a combination of factors, including snowpack conditions, weather, terrain, and human activity. Here's a basic explanation from a physicist's perspective, along with some survival tips:

Snowpack Conditions: Layers of snow accumulate over the winter. Some layers may be weak due to differences in crystal size and shape, caused by varying weather conditions. A weak layer buried under a slab of harder snow can cause an avalanche if disturbed.

Weather: Rapid warming, heavy snowfall, or rain can destabilize the snowpack. Sudden temperature changes can weaken layers within the snow.

Terrain: Slopes between 30 to 45 degrees are most prone to avalanches. Features like cliffs, gullies, and changes in slope angle can also affect stability.

Human Activity: Skiers, snowboarders, or snowmobiles can trigger avalanches, especially on slopes with unstable snow.

Tips for Surviving an Avalanche:
Preparation: Before heading into avalanche terrain, check the local avalanche forecast. Carry avalanche safety gear – a beacon, probe, and shovel.

Awareness: Be aware of your surroundings and avoid terrain traps like narrow valleys where snow can pile up deeply.

Ride Smart: If skiing or snowboarding, go one at a time on risky slopes and watch from safe spots.

In an Avalanche: Try to move to the side of the slide. If caught, try to 'swim' to stay near the surface. Once the snow slows, create space around your face for air and try to push an arm towards the surface.

Rescue Techniques: If someone else is caught, use your beacon to locate them and dig them out as quickly as possible.

Remember, the best way to survive an avalanche is to avoid getting caught in one in the first place. Education, proper planning, and respecting the power of nature are key.","Tahoe avalanches: What causes innocent-looking snow slopes to collapse?

"Tahoe avalanches: What causes innocent-looking snow slopes to collapse? A physicist and skier explains, with tips for surviving.

An avalanche swept up skiers at Lake Tahoe’s largest ski resort on Jan. 10, 2024, as a 150-foot-wide sheet of snow slid down a mountain slope into a pile 10 feet deep. One person died in the avalanche and three others were rescued, according to the Placer County, California, Sheriff’s Office. The slide happened in steep terrain near the KT-22 chairlift, which had just opened for the season that morning. A second unplanned avalanche hit the same ski resort the next day, but no one was injured.

Avalanche deaths are rare inbounds at ski resorts like Palisades Tahoe, but the risk rises in the backcountry – 30 backcountry avalanche deaths were reported in the U.S. during the 2022-2023 season. Nathalie Vriend, a skier and physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies avalanches, explains what happens in an avalanche and techniques for surviving one.

What causes avalanches?
The behavior of an avalanche depends on the structure of the snowpack, but that’s only one ingredient. An avalanche requires all the wrong conditions at the wrong time.

The angle of the mountain slope is important. Slopes between 25 and 40 degrees run the greatest risk of avalanches. Those are also ideal for skiing, of course. If the slope is less than 25 degrees, there might be little slips, but the snow won’t pick up speed. If it’s over 40 degrees, the snow typically cannot accumulate, clearing away the avalanche risk.

Then there needs to be a trigger. A snowpack may be seemingly stable until a snowmobile or skier disturbs it enough that the snow starts to move. Strong winds or rock falls may also cause an avalanche. Blowing snow can create wind loading and build up into cornices, creating an overhang that can eventually fall and trigger an avalanche below.

What happens inside the snowpack during an avalanche?
Mountain snowpack isn’t uniform. Because it builds up over time, it is a snapshot of recent weather conditions and has both stable and weak layers.

When snow falls, it’s a fluffy crystal structure. But when the temperature rises and the snow starts to melt and then refreezes, it turns more granular.

That granular, icier snow is a weak layer. When a new snowfall dumps on top of it, the grains in the weak layer can shear, creating a surface for an avalanche to slide on. The weight of new snowpack can cause the entire face of a mountain to fall away almost instantaneously. As the avalanche picks up speed, more snow and debris are incorporated in the avalanche and it can become really big and violent.

In my lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder, I study small-scale laboratory avalanches. We use a technique called photoelasticity and create thin avalanches to reveal what’s going on inside the avalanche. We track photoelastic particles with a high-speed camera and can observe that particles bounce and collide really fast, within 1/1,000th of a second.

In a real avalanche, those violent collisions create a lot of heat through friction, which causes more melting. As the avalanche comes to a rest, this liquid can quickly refreeze again, locking the snowpack in place like concrete. People say “swim to the surface” in an avalanche, but you may not know whether the surface is up or down. If the avalanche is still moving and the granules haven’t frozen solid again, you might be able to move slightly, but it is really hard.

What can skiers do if they’re in an avalanche?
I’ve done fieldwork on real snow avalanches triggered intentionally in Switzerland. We were in a bunker in a valley, and they dropped explosives at the top of the mountain. Using radar, we could look inside the avalanche as it came toward us. It was easily going more than 110 miles per hour (50 meters per second).

Even if the avalanche is small, you can’t outski or outrun it easily. The big danger is when the snow is deep – you could be buried under several feet of snow. Basically, as the avalanche slows down, new snow keeps piling on top of you. People report this as being trapped in concrete without an ability to even move a limb. It must be a very frightening experience.

Backcountry skiers carry tools that can increase their chances of survival. Your best bet, though, is your peers – particularly in the backcountry, where emergency crews will take hours to arrive.

There are a few things you can do. First, carry a transceiver, which transmits a signal identifying your location. When you are caught in an avalanche, you are transmitting a signal. Your friends can switch their transceivers to the “receiving” mode and try to locate your beacon. It’s also important to have an avalanche probe and a shovel in the backcountry for when your friends do locate your position: The snow is like concrete, and it will be hard to extract you.

Avalanche air bags can also help – James Bond used an elaborate concept of one in “The World Is Not Enough.” With modern avalanche air bags, you pull a toggle on your back, and the air bag inflates behind your head, turning you into a bigger particle. Bigger particles tend to stay at the surface, making you easier to locate.

How is avalanche risk changing as winter temperatures rise?
It’s an important question, and it’s not as simple as warming temperatures mean less snow, so fewer avalanches. Instead, if mountains have more variation in temperatures, they may have more melting and refreezing phases during the winter, creating weaker snowpacks compared with historical records.

The historical conditions that communities have grown up around can change. In 2017, there was a big avalanche in Italy that took out an entire hotel. It was in an area where people didn’t expect an avalanche, based on historical data.

There are computer models that can calculate where avalanches are likely to occur. But when temperatures, snowfall and precipitation patterns change, you may not be able to truly understand cause and effect on natural hazards like snow avalanches.",https://theconversation.com/tahoe-avalanches-what-causes-innocent-looking-snow-slopes-to-collapse-a-physicist-and-skier-explains-with-tips-for-surviving-220943,real,0
"As snow blankets Pittsburgh, severe weather advisory to take effect for frigid wind chills.

As winter tightens its grip on Pittsburgh, a serene white blanket of snow has descended upon the city, transforming it into a picturesque winter wonderland. However, amid the scenic beauty, residents are urged to brace themselves for an impending severe weather advisory.

"As snow blankets Pittsburgh, severe weather advisory to take effect for frigid wind chills.

After a round of light snow coated Pittsburgh overnight, a weather advisory is warning of wind chills dropping to negatives over the next day. Schools across the region have already shut down or delayed opening.

Lee Hendricks, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said the city will see some lingering flurries Tuesday morning, but the snow, accumulating by 1 to 2 inches, should subside before the afternoon. The temperature will steady around 17 degrees.

Pittsburgh roads conditions should improve once that snowfall ends. The blowing snow will hover just about one to two feet above the ground, so it shouldn’t affect visibility too much, he said.

After a mild December, Mr. Hendricks notes that the city is still seeing lower levels of snow than its average, with just over 5 inches so far this month compared to the normal 10 inches.

“What has happened here is just that our pattern has changed, so we're getting these surges of colder air coming out of Canada,” he said. “We're having another reinforcement of that cold air coming in here tonight and tomorrow. That's going to pretty much control things through the end of the week.”

It’s likely that the Pittsburgh area isn’t going to see temperatures above freezing until Monday, he said. Due to the bitter wind chill, the National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory for portions of Western Pennsylvania from 10 p.m. Tuesday through noon Wednesday.

As the light snow tapers off Tuesday morning, drier, colder air will move in from the west, sweeping Pittsburgh with winds up 10 to 15 miles per hour. That could bring the wind chill down to -10 during the night, Mr. Hendricks said.

The Pittsburgh International Airport had picked up about 1 ½ an inch of light, fluffy snow by Tuesday morning. Most flights still arrived and departed on time, and are scheduled to continue doing so – with the exception of some cancelled flights to and from cities such as New York, Boston and Houston.

As the cold and snow set in, dozens of schools across Allegheny County closed down for the day, including Pittsburgh public schools. The city’s district made the call “due to worsening road conditions and driver call offs,” a morning Facebook post told parents and students. Others have opted to push back the school day, with districts like Allegheny-Clarion and East Allegheny on 2-hour delays. And some have pivoted to online instruction, including the Duquesne City, Chartiers Valley and West Mifflin Area Schools.

Mr. Hendricks expects conditions to be more hazardous for tomorrow’s commuters and students. Wednesday’s forecast is looking sunnier, with temperatures increasing to the low 20’s. But still, winds may gust up to 30 miles per hour, and the wind chill could feel as frigid as -12.

“The problem is tonight with the winds and this fluffy snow, there will be some melting today, so that blowing and drifting snow could cause some black ice issues,” he said. “Bridges and overpasses are always the most notable areas.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/news/weather-news/2024/01/16/pittsburgh-weather-snow/stories/202401160067,real,0

"Pittsburgh coffee chain closes all locations shortly after employees announce union efforts.

**Title: Pittsburgh Coffee Chain Shuts Down Every Location Following Employee Unionization Announcement**

*Pittsburgh, PA - January 12, 2024*

In a surprising turn of events, a popular coffee chain in Pittsburgh has decided to permanently close all its locations shortly after employees publicly declared their intention to unionize. The announcement has sent shockwaves through the local community, sparking debates about workers' rights and the impact of unionization on businesses.

The coffee chain, known for its cozy ambiance and artisanal brews, had been a staple in the Pittsburgh community for years. However, tensions had been brewing among employees who sought better working conditions, fair wages, and improved benefits. The decision to unionize was seen as a collective effort to address these concerns.

The employees made their unionization announcement just days before the unexpected closure. In a joint statement, they expressed their desire for a stronger voice in workplace decisions and improved treatment. The news was met with mixed reactions from customers, some showing support for the employees' rights, while others expressed disappointment about the closure of a beloved local establishment.

The coffee chain's management, in a brief statement, cited financial challenges as the primary reason for the closures. They emphasized that the decision was made independently of the employees' unionization efforts. However, skeptics argue that the timing of the closures raises suspicions about the true motives behind the sudden shutdown.

Local labor rights activists and unions have rallied in support of the affected employees, condemning the management's decision to close all locations. Calls for investigations into potential labor law violations have intensified, with some alleging that the company might be attempting to undermine the employees' right to organize.

City officials have also weighed in on the controversy, promising a thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the closures. Pittsburgh Mayor, Sarah Thompson, stated, ""We are committed to ensuring that workers' rights are protected, and we will investigate any potential wrongdoing in this matter. The closure of a business in response to unionization efforts raises concerns that must be addressed.""

As the community grapples with the closure of the beloved coffee chain, the incident has ignited discussions about the challenges faced by workers attempting to unionize, especially in industries known for resistance to collective bargaining. The long-term impact on the local economy and the fate of the employees left jobless remain uncertain, adding a layer of complexity to the ongoing controversy.

This situation serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between business interests and workers' rights, prompting a broader conversation about the need for fair labor practices and protections in an ever-evolving economic landscape.","Generate a news article for the following title:

"Pittsburgh coffee chain closes all locations shortly after employees announce union efforts.

Local coffee chain Adda Coffee & Tea House announced Thursday that it is closing all four of its Pittsburgh locations, shortly after its workers declared plans to unionize.

In a social media post Thursday evening, Adda management said that the business had been “operating at a loss,” since opening in 2016. The post also said the pandemic had negatively impacted the business, leading ownership to close all stores permanently.

Adda had locations in Shadyside, Garfield, North Side and Downtown. 

“We tried to stay optimistic and have been constantly re-evaluating our business model in our efforts to keep fulfilling our mission,” Adda management wrote. “Despite everyone’s best efforts, our monetary reserves are depleted and we need to close our doors.” 

The announcement came just hours after the coffee shop’s employees announced plans to undergo unionizing efforts on social media. 

“We’re unionizing because we love our jobs, and we deserve a say in how our store is run,” Adda employees wrote in Instagram and Twitter posts. “In order to do our best work, we need living wages, consistent scheduling, comprehensive workplace policies, and a tip structure that empowers us to foster a stellar customer experience. Forming a union is the best way to improve our working conditions, and we can’t wait for this next chapter in our store’s history. We have a lot of great ideas about how to improve things at our store, and we’re excited for the opportunity to make our voices heard.”

Sukanta Nag, owner of Adda Coffee & Tea House, said he had been considering closing since last year. He said he held a meeting with employees on Wednesday to “brainstorm ideas to grow the business,” but decided later that evening to close.

“We have two types of employees,” Mr Nag said in an interview with the Post-Gazette. “We have the management team, I have frequent discussions with them (and) they have been aware of our financial condition for many, many months. With respect to the baristas, they may have had some idea because we lowered some scheduled hours in January and December. There have been many signals that we have had constraints on cash and expenses.”

Since Adda’s announcement Thursday evening, employees have taken to social media to question the timing of the closure, with some claiming retaliation by management. The closures resulted in 33 jobs lost, according to employees.

Adda management “has decided to close our doors abruptly and shockingly after thousands [of] hours of hard work from his workers, who have spent extra time for a low rate to make up for his lack of management and foresight,” Adda employees posted on Instagram. Adda employee representatives could not be reached.

Mr. Nag said the closures had no correlation to unionizing efforts and that the decision was entirely to “stop our losses.”

“I was given the union petition in that same meeting, earlier in the meeting, which we did not focus on because there was a great agenda put together by the leadership team and myself,” Mr. Nag said. “So we had a long meeting. It was really clear that all the guidance everybody had was us investing more money that we do not have. So I did not have any time to focus on the union.”",https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2024/01/12/adda-coffeehouse-unionize-pittsburgh-closed/stories/202401120083,real,0

"Installing an artificial heart allowed the 34-year-old to regain his ""heart"" life.

34-year-old Cheng Guang (pseudonym) suffered from severe heart failure and his health was deteriorating. Recently, the Cardiovascular Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University successfully installed an artificial heart on him, allowing him to regain his ""heart"" life! The artificial heart is a new type of medical device. Through the combination of engineering technology and medical knowledge, it is designed as a set of artificial pumps that can simulate the pumping function of the natural heart to assist or even replace the blood circulation function of the own heart. An artificial heart can improve blood supply throughout the body by pumping blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. Cheng Guang has a family history of dilated heart disease. He started having chest tightness and asthma 3 years ago. The EF (cardiac ejection fraction) value representing heart function is more than 50% of normal people. Cheng Guang only has 26%-33%, which is severe heart failure. His health deteriorated. Li Qingguo, vice president of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and director of the Cardiovascular Center, performed the left ventricular assist system implantation. During the operation, Vice President Li Qingguo installed an artificial heart for Cheng Guang. After the operation, his cardiac output was monitored to be normal, and his systemic blood supply was significantly improved. The tracheal intubation was removed under deep anesthesia 10 minutes after the operation. On the day of the operation, Cheng Guang had a video call with his family. Qian Qi, Director of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Team of the Cardiovascular Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital, conducted a cardiac assessment for Cheng Guang before the operation and customized a cardiac rehabilitation plan, including three stages: pre-operative pre-rehabilitation, postoperative acute-phase rehabilitation, and recovery-phase rehabilitation. The recovery period includes Phase I cardiac rehabilitation during hospitalization and Phase II cardiac rehabilitation after returning home. During the post-operative acute recovery period, Cheng Guang, with the assistance of medical staff and ECG and blood pressure monitoring, carried out rehabilitation training such as breathing training and muscle joint training. On the first day after the operation, Cheng Guang sat beside the bed for 5 minutes with assistance. On the second day after surgery, you can sit and stand independently for 7 minutes without assistance. On the third day after surgery, with the encouragement of fellow patients who had undergone the same surgery, Cheng Guang began to try to stand with assistance. On the sixth day after the operation, after rehabilitation training, Cheng Guang was successfully transferred out of the intensive care unit. Last weekend, through rehabilitation training during the recovery period during hospitalization, Cheng Guang was discharged from the hospital and started his ""heart"" life. Before being discharged from the hospital, Cheng Guang did a 6-minute walking test and was able to walk 380 meters on his own. After returning home, he will continue the next step of cardiac rehabilitation training under the guidance of a doctor, improve exercise endurance, improve quality of life, change his mentality, and strive to return to society as soon as possible. Experts say that the successful recovery of critically ill patients requires multidisciplinary cooperation, and targeted rehabilitation training can help patients rebuild their confidence and return to society as soon as possible. Studies have shown that cardiac rehabilitation with exercise as the core can significantly improve the exercise tolerance of heart failure patients, improve the quality of life, improve depression, reduce the risk of rehospitalization, and improve clinical prognosis. According to statistics, there are 1 million patients with end-stage heart failure in my country, but there are only about 400-700 heart transplant donors every year. The shortage of heart donors is a common situation. Nowadays, the research and development and clinical application of artificial hearts in China are very mature. Artificial hearts are suitable for patients with end-stage heart failure and those waiting for heart transplantation. They can significantly improve the quality of life of patients. They can be used not only as a transitional means before waiting for heart transplantation, but also as a lifelong means of support.",http://jlwb.njdaily.cn/html/2024-01/16/content_559_132772.htm,real,0

"Bengaluru traffic police launch AI-backed ASTraM app.

The Bengaluru traffic police department on Saturday launched its new artificial intelligence (AI)-backed ASTraM app which will provide holistic insights on road traffic scenarios for the city. The app was launched as part of the Road Safety Awareness Week.

The ASTraM or Actionable Intelligence for Sustainable Traffic Management app aims to provide the Bengaluru traffic police with situational awareness to take data driven decisions for effective traffic management. This includes congestion alerts, incident reporting using a BOT (mobile application), special event management, dashboard analytics, and much more.

Congestion Alerts

This initiative intends to provide real-time alerts on congestion to the jurisdictional traffic officials every 15 minutes. This is integrated with the traffic department’s e- attendance system so that alerts are sent to the junction jockeys and sector officers. This alert also provides updates on congestion to various stakeholders for better traffic planning and management.

Dashboard Analytics

This feature of the software intends to provide actionable intelligence regarding the traffic condition, road safety and enforcement. The main purpose is to tabulate the volume and quantum of traffic in terms of congestion length, vehicle count, vehicle type, to make data driven decisions for effective traffic management. Using the analytics, Bengaluru Traffic Police (BTP) also intend to predict traffic congestion so that any deviation from the regular volume can be handled better by disseminating information to the various stakeholders. This keeps track of historic data, enabling a comparative analysis with real-time traffic, according to the traffic department.

Incident Reporting using BOT

The purpose of this BOT service is to report any field incident from the authorized sources so that corresponding information is shared with the map services, which provides the public with real-time information. Based on this reporting, BTP’s Traffic Management Center (TMC) monitors the on-field traffic situation for resolving the same in coordination with the jurisdictional traffic officials and other stakeholders.

Special Event Management

This feature keeps a log of all major events in the city and gives a spatial understanding of the traffic situation for better response management in terms of allocating resources and planning other alternative measures. According to traffic officials, such events are continuously monitored centrally from TMC, ensuring that required information is disseminated for quick action.

Ambulance Tracking Application

This application is to ensure coordinated movement for the ambulances across the city. Through the application, the control room would be monitoring the movement of the registered ambulance from the source to the destination.

"Cause of Hawaii-bound plane crash near Half Moon Bay revealed by NTSB.

The National Transportation Safety Board released its investigation report on Friday revealing what caused a small private plane to crash into the Pacific Ocean near Half Moon Bay last May.

Everyone onboard the Viking Air DHC-6-400 — a pilot and one passenger — were killed in the accident. Their bodies were never recovered from the ocean, the report states.

The plane took off from Charles M Schulz-Sonoma County Airport in Santa Rosa and was destined for Honolulu, Hawaii on the morning of May 20.

The airplane had a ferry tank system installed and 540 gallons of extra fuel added for the trans-Pacific flight. The airplane’s amphibious floats were also removed before takeoff.

Mid-flight and 356 miles off California’s coast, the pilot reported having trouble accessing the plane’s extra fuel, decided to turn around, and attempted to make it back to California, investigators said.

The NTSB report states, “Satellite flight tracking data showed the airplane on a southwest heading over the ocean at an altitude of about 15,500 ft mean sea level. About 4 hours into the flight, the crew contacted ATC and reported that they were having a problem transferring fuel from the ferry tanks and that they intended to return. The flight track reversed course. At 11:45 time, the flight crew reported that they lost fuel pressure and an engine. The last few minutes of the data shows an altitude drop from about 3,600 to about 240 ft msl.”

The crash’s impact into the ocean caused major damages to the plane and the wings ripped off. The last satellite flight tracking data point was 33 miles off the coast.

A U.S. Coast Guard crew found the partially submerged plane in the ocean and confirmed the pilot and passenger had died.

NTSB’s report writes, “Examination of the wreckage in the water revealed that the fuselage was inverted, and the wings and engines separated from the airplane. The horizontal stabilizer remained partially attached to the empennage and the forward fuselage had impact damage.”

The report did not include the identities of the two victims who died in the crash.",https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/cause-of-hawaii-bound-plane-crash-near-half-moon-bay-revealed-by-ntsb/,real,0

"Trump fumes as penalty phase of defamation trial begins.

NEW YORK — Donald Trump shook his head in disgust Tuesday as the judge in his New York defamation trial told prospective jurors that another jury had already decided the former president sexually abused columnist E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s.

Fresh from a political win Monday in the Iowa caucuses, the Republican presidential frontrunner detoured to a Manhattan courtroom for what amounts to the penalty phase of a civil defamation lawsuit stemming from Carroll’s claims he sexually attacked her in a department store dressing room.

Prospective jurors were told the trial was likely to last three to five days. Opening statements come next.

Trump did not attend the previous trial in the case last May, when a jury found he had sexually abused Carroll and awarded her $5 million in damages. In light of that verdict, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan told prospective jurors the trial beginning Tuesday would focus only on how much money, if any, Trump must pay Carroll for comments he made about her while president in 2019.

For purposes of the new trial, it had already been determined that Trump “did sexually assault Ms. Carroll,” Kaplan said, prompting Trump to shake his head from side to side. The ex-president was sitting at the defense table, flanked by his lawyers, about a dozen feet (3.7 meters) from Carroll and her legal team. They didn’t appear to speak or make eye contact.

As the day began, Kaplan rejected the defense’s request to suspended the trial on Thursday so Trump could attend his mother-in-law’s funeral — part of a combative exchange in which Trump’s lawyers accused the judge of thwarting their defense with pretrial evidence rulings they contend were favorable to Carroll.

“I am not stopping him from being there,” the judge said, referring to the funeral.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba responded: “No, you’re stopping him from being here.”

Habba told the judge that Trump plans to testify. Kaplan said the only accommodation he would make is that Trump can testify on Monday, even if the trial is otherwise finished by Thursday. The judge previously rejected Trump’s request to delay the trial a week.

Trump sat attentively, glaring and scowling at times, as about six-dozen prospective jurors filed into the courtroom and spent more than an hour responding to questions posed by the judge covering everything from their prior involvement with the judicial system to their political beliefs.

He twisted around in his chair to get a look at two prospective jurors — a man and woman — who stood when asked if they agreed with his false belief that the 2020 election was rigged, and again when three people in the pool indicated they felt the former president was being treated unfairly by the court system.

The process offered a window into the political beliefs of a microcosm of New Yorkers, drawn from a pool that includes Manhattan and northern suburban counties. Some noted personal connections to Trump or his adversaries. One woman said she had done publicity for his daughter’s company. Another said her father provided moving services for some of Trump’s buildings. Both said they could be fair and impartial and remained among prospective jurors.

Jurors selected for the trial will remain anonymous, even to the parties, lawyers and judicial staff, and will be driven to and from the courthouse from an undisclosed location for their safety, Kaplan said.

Trump has increasingly made his courtroom travails — including four criminal cases — part of his run to retake the White House, positioning himself as a victim of partisan lawyers, judges and prosecutors and capitalizing on news coverage that accompanies his court visits. Last week, Trump attended closing arguments in the New York attorney general’s fraud lawsuit against him — and ended up giving a six-minute diatribe after his lawyers spoke.

“I guess you’d consider it part of the campaign,” Trump told reporters last week.

True to form, Trump fired off a series of social media posts about the defamation case after arriving to the courthouse Tuesday via motorcade and entering through a special entrance not usually used by the public. Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that Carroll’s rape allegation was an “attempted EXTORTION” involving “fabricated lies and political shenanigans.” He accused the judge of having “absolute hatred” for him.

Carroll, 80, plans to testify about the damage to her career and reputation that resulted from Trump’s public statements. She seeks $10 million in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages.

If Trump testifies, he will be under strict limits on what he can say. Because of the prior verdict, Kaplan has said, Trump cannot get on the witness stand and argue that he didn’t sexually abuse or defame Carroll.

Even before prospective jurors were brought into court on Tuesday, Trump attorney Michael Madaio complained that the judge had made “inconsistent and unfair” rulings against Trump prior to the start of the trial. He said the rulings “drastically changed our ability to defend this case and largely stripped us of our defenses.”

He also argued that given Trump’s pending appeal, the trial should not proceed at all.

Trump, 77, has continued to maintain that he doesn’t know Carroll, that he never met her at the Bergdorf Goodman store in midtown Manhattan in spring 1996 and that Carroll made up her claims to sell her book and for political reasons.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/01/16/trump-fumes-as-penalty-phase-of-defamation-trial-begins/,real,0
"Trump fumes as penalty phase of defamation trial begins.

Washington, D.C. — In a courtroom drama that has captured the nation's attention, former President Donald Trump is reportedly fuming as the penalty phase of a high-profile defamation trial commences. The trial, stemming from allegations of damaging remarks, has thrust Trump back into the legal spotlight.

The trial, which has been a source of controversy since its inception, is now entering a critical phase as both parties prepare to present arguments related to potential penalties. Trump, known for his strong-willed legal defense strategies, is expected to vigorously contest any adverse rulings.

Sources close to the former President have indicated a sense of frustration as he confronts the possibility of financial consequences resulting from the trial. The stakes are undeniably high, and the outcome could have lasting implications for Trump's post-presidential legacy.

The defamation trial revolves around comments made by Trump, with the plaintiff asserting that these remarks caused harm to their reputation. Trump's legal team is anticipated to assert that his statements fall within the boundaries of protected speech, emphasizing the importance of free expression.

Media scrutiny surrounding the trial has been intense, with journalists closely following every development. The case has become a focal point for discussions on the intersection of law, politics, and the responsibility of public figures.

The trial's impact extends beyond the courtroom, influencing public perception and contributing to ongoing debates surrounding accountability for public figures. As the penalty phase unfolds, the nation watches closely, awaiting a verdict that could set a precedent for future cases involving prominent individuals and defamation claims.

"Homewood Stories turns 10: Celebrating a decade of community-building — one tale at a time.

On Jan. 21, 2014, Homewood dentist Karen O’Donnell raised the curtain on a local storytelling tradition for an audience of 45 hardy souls who had to fight their way through a polar vortex just to hear strangers share pieces of their personal experiences from a stage at Grady’s Grill.
Ten years, six venues, and a pandemic later, Homewood Stories is still going strong.
In fact, every third Tuesday of the month, the hottest ticket in town is for a seat at a big round table in the Flossmoor Community House, where the pre-show atmosphere is reminiscent of a tailgate before a big game, only this one is indoors.
An hour before showtime, people greet neighbors and newcomers while they unpack their coolers, break bread, breach barriers and watch a live stage show.
It is exactly what O’Donnell envisioned when she decided to put together a production showcasing individuals speaking from the heart about their personal experiences.
“Oral communication and written communication are very different,” says O’Donnell. “We all have personal experiences that could be a story. The key is that all the stories told at Homewood Stories are true, not fairytales, not SciFi.”
O’Donnell jokes that her own love of storytelling was born of talking to a captive audience of patients — one at a time — while they underwent dental work in her office. “I get to tell stories in my day job as a dentist,” she quipped, adding that her running narratives often help reduce patient stress.
Ten years ago, O’Donnell decided it was time to use her storytelling talent to connect with a larger audience, and Homewood Stories was born. Today there are more than 40 storytelling shows/series in the Chicago area alone, some concentrate on stories related to specific ethnic communities or special interest groups, but Homewood Stories concentrates on personal experience stories from individuals no matter their background. It is the only show of that genre in the South Suburbs.
“Homewood Stories is different from shows in the city because we’re all about community,” O’Donnell says.
She opens each session by recapping the house rules and the general story format: There usually are five storytellers per session (four guests and O’Donnell). They don’t use notes or memorize their stories, which must be about real experiences and situations and no more than 10 minutes long, though no one gets the hook if they go over.
Dusty Patrick was one of the storytellers at the October session.
“I was our family storyteller for a while and then Karen dropped off flyers advertising Homewood Stories at my building. I came to the first in-person session after COVID,” said the 80-years-young Patrick, who told a vivid, often hilarious, always engaging, first-person account of a 12-hour trek with a friend through a raging snowstorm.
Patrick shared that she was motivated to leave the safety of her office building and take on the storm because she was determined to sleep in her own bed and not at her workplace that night.
To accomplish that, she had to walk 23 blocks through driving wind and snowdrifts while having to stop frequently to push her reluctant friend to keep going. It took more than 12 hours for her to get home, but she made it!

During her presentation, Patrick never mentioned the date of her experience, but it was instant deja vu for anyone in the room who had lived through the Chicago Blizzard of ’67.
At the November session, Patrick was strictly a member of the audience. She confided that she is expanding her new career in professional storytelling and soon will be sharing her memories as a member of the Chicago Association of Black Storytellers. “This [storytelling] is the best thing God ever led me to,” Patrick said.
Tom Dobrez, whose roots run deep in Flossmoor, reached back into his childhood for a story about family, sports, and a missed opportunity that has become one of his fondest memories.
Dobrez is a radio consultant for hundreds of small radio stations across the country, and he also is a founding member of Flossmoor’s Future, a non-profit volunteer group that initiated and promotes such events as the Flossmoor GEM half-marathon, Bike the GEM, and Plant the GEM.
But it is Dobrez’s love of sports and family that came through in his humorous, poignant story about being inadvertently left behind—and left out of—a large family outing to a Chicago White Sox game when he was a kid. Think “Home Alone,” but with a wonderful aunt who made him feel special and loved while he waited for everyone to return from the game (which the Sox lost).
Dobrez has put many of his recollections into print and at intermission, he autographed copies of his newly published memoir “Root, Root, Root for the Home Teams.”
(For more information about Dobrez’s book, go to RootRootRootBook.com.)
In the same session, Eric McLendon of Berwyn told the bittersweet story of a unique family tradition—the Grogan cake. He said that his mom baked a Grogan once a year on New Year’s Day morning when he would wake up to the aroma of cinnamon, chocolate, pecans and caramel, an experience that is still vivid for him.
No one in his family knew where the tradition started, and the recipe eventually was lost, but the memories of his father and mother and the tradition of the Grogan live on in McLendon’s heart.
McLendon is very active on the storytelling circuit and was one of six storytellers selected to present to an audience of more than 1,000 people at the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, Tennessee.
Karen O’Donnell shares one of her many personal experiences at every Homewood Stories session. She revealed what motivates her to put so much energy into the franchise: O’Donnell said she cares deeply about the Homewood-Flossmoor community and she believes that helping people find common ground—no matter who they are or what they have experienced in life—is key to any strong community.
Giving people a venue to share their true selves with each other has become a mission for her.
“I want to see the ‘you’ in every story, and I am so excited to bring people together to share gifts of the heart,” she said. “I want to make sure the audience leaves uplifted. After all, they are coming here to have a good time.”

"Comment丨China’s first securities class action settlement case is significant not only in the compensation of 280 million yuan.

According to reports, recently, the Shanghai Financial Court’s case of a securities misrepresentation liability dispute involving 12 defendants, including the listed company Zeda Yisheng (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd. and its actual controllers, executives, and intermediaries, was settled through mediation. Effective - This case is the country's first lawsuit involving a special representative of a company listed on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, and it is also the first settlement of a securities class action lawsuit in China.

Through mediation, 7,195 investors received full compensation of more than 280 million yuan, of which a single investor received a maximum compensation of more than 5 million yuan, with an average compensation of 38,900 yuan per investor. The successful mediation of this case is not only a timely remedy for the rights and interests of investors, but also a profound warning to the entire capital market.

It is worth mentioning that this case involves multiple defendants and various types of legal relationships. In addition to the listed company itself, its actual controller and senior executives, the other three intermediaries and their directly responsible personnel also bear substantial liability for compensation. As the ""gatekeepers"" of the capital market, intermediaries' professionalism and impartiality play an important role in ensuring the authenticity, completeness and timeliness of information disclosure. In previous judicial practices, the responsibilities of intermediaries were often regarded as secondary or indirect. However, in the Zeda Yisheng case, the intermediaries actively compensated investors and applied for the implementation of the administrative law enforcement party commitment system, which reflected their responsibility for their own faults. Reflection and acceptance of punishment.

On the one hand, the compensation behavior of intermediaries reveals the determination of my country’s regulatory authorities to consolidate the legal responsibilities of intermediaries and strengthen the market integrity mechanism; on the other hand, it sets a precedent standard for similar cases in the future and warns all intermediaries that they must adhere to their profession. Otherwise, you will face real financial and reputational losses. This stringent requirement on the behavioral norms of intermediaries is essentially a major benefit to the ecological health of the entire capital market and will help promote the formation of a more rigorous, transparent, and responsible market environment.

The greatest significance of this class action settlement is to reduce the cost of rights protection and effectively protect the rights and interests of small and medium-sized investors. In the past, investors who suffered losses due to illegal acts of listed companies often faced the dilemma of high costs, long time, and difficulty in safeguarding their rights. Group disputes involved a wide range of litigation subjects and many disputed issues. Even after the trial, the court sentenced investors Compensation can be obtained, but the solvency of listed companies has been very limited due to the negative impact of long-term litigation, and investors' rights to win the lawsuit cannot be truly protected. This collective action mediation not only simplifies the rights protection procedures and reduces the costs of rights protection, but also allows the compensation funds to be quickly received, which greatly enhances investors' sense of security and gain.

In the securities market, small and medium investors are often in a weak position and their rights and interests are often violated. As a result of this settlement, 7,195 investors received more than 280 million yuan in compensation, which is undoubtedly a strong protection for their rights and interests. This is not only a timely remedy for investors, but also an encouragement to small investors in the entire market.

This settlement also brings a positive signal to the market. It shows that China's securities market is gradually maturing and the market's legalization process is constantly advancing. This not only helps to enhance the credibility of the market, but also helps to attract investors. More investors participate in the market and promote the healthy development of the market.

However, reconciliation is not easy, and not all corporate violations are eligible for reconciliation. The key to protecting the rights and interests of investors still lies in the advancement of the legalization process and the strengthening of supervision. The rule of law is the cornerstone of the healthy development of the capital market. Only on the track of the rule of law can the rights and interests of investors be effectively protected. In this process, regulatory authorities should continue to increase supervision of the market, strictly enforce the law, and maintain the fairness, transparency, and health of the market; listed companies should strengthen self-discipline, standardize operations, and ensure the authenticity, accuracy, and completeness of information disclosure; intermediaries They should fulfill their duties as ""gatekeepers"" to ensure the quality of issuance and listed companies; investors should strengthen their awareness of self-protection, invest rationally, and prevent risks.

The success of this settlement is not only good news for small and medium-sized investors, but also a powerful deterrent to lawbreakers. It tells us that the capital market is not a place outside the law, and violations must be investigated and guilty must be punished. At the same time, there is still a long way to go to protect the rights and interests of investors, which requires joint efforts from all parties to maintain a fair, transparent, and healthy capital market environment.

"Comment丨China’s first securities class action settlement case is significant not only in the compensation of 280 million yuan.

Historic Precedent in Chinese Securities Law: This case marks a significant milestone in the evolution of securities law in China. Class action lawsuits, especially in the securities domain, are a relatively new concept in China compared to Western countries. The successful conclusion of such a case demonstrates the maturing of the legal system in handling complex financial disputes.

Large Scale Compensation: The compensation amount of 280 million yuan is noteworthy. It indicates the seriousness with which Chinese authorities are treating securities fraud and the level of protection they are willing to offer to investors. This sizeable compensation could serve as a deterrent against corporate malfeasance.

Investor Protection and Market Confidence: This settlement is a strong message to investors about their rights and the protections available to them. This could lead to increased investor confidence in the Chinese markets, knowing that there are mechanisms in place to address grievances and financial misconduct.

Regulatory Implications: The settlement might prompt further regulatory reforms to strengthen oversight in the securities market. It could lead to more stringent disclosure requirements, better corporate governance standards, and enhanced accountability for companies listed on Chinese stock exchanges.

Global Implications: As China's financial markets become increasingly integrated with the global economy, actions like these could have international ramifications. It signals to foreign investors and regulatory bodies that China is aligning with global standards in financial regulation and legal recourse.

Challenges and Future Prospects: While this case is a leap forward, it also highlights the challenges in China's legal system, such as the

need for more streamlined procedures, increased transparency, and the development of more robust legal frameworks to handle such complex cases. As the market evolves, so will the legal challenges, necessitating continuous reforms and adaptations.

This case sets a precedent and may pave the way for more such actions in the future, potentially leading to a more regulated and investor-friendly environment in China's securities market. It also reflects China's growing efforts to align with international financial and legal standards, which could have far-reaching effects on its economic policies and international relations.","Me: Generate a article with that title, make it look like a news

"Jewish civil rights organization suing Carnegie Mellon University.

PITTSBURGH — A Jewish civil rights organization is suing Carnegie Mellon University.

The Lawfare Project claims a Jewish student was repeatedly subjected to antisemitic discrimination while attending CMU.

The organization said the student filed multiple complaints with the administration that were never resolved. The student claimed she was denied an excused absence to attend a memorial service after the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue.

A release from The Lawfare Project said the student created a model to depict how an Orthodox Jewish community turned a public space into a private one for religious purposes. In response, an instructor allegedly said it would have been better if she had done her project on “what Jewish people do to make themselves so hated.”

“In addition to seeking justice for the aggrieved student, this lawsuit endeavors to expose the toxic undercurrent of antisemitism that for years has corroded academia and has laid the foundation for the unbridled Jew-hatred that has become rampant on college campuses since Hamas’s attack on Israel,” said Ziporah Reich, Director of Litigation at The Lawfare Project.

Carnegie Mellon University gave Channel 11 the following statement:

“We are steadfast in our commitment to create and nurture a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment where all students can reach their potential and thrive. We take any allegations of mistreatment or harassment seriously. We have just received notice of this lawsuit and we will evaluate and respond to it.”

"New Barnes & Noble Opens In Morris County At Former Ledgewood Mall.

MORRIS COUNTY, NJ — A popular Barnes & Noble location, which closed down more than three years ago, has officially reopened its doors to the public.

The new Barnes & Noble storefront is located at what is now called the Shops at Ledgewood Commons (461 State Route 10, Ledgewood), next to DSW and Ulta Beauty.

The bookshop formally opened to the public on Wednesday, with author Amy Jo Burns cutting the ribbon and signing copies of Mercury, January's B&N Book Club pick.

“Our return to the newly redeveloped Ledgewood Commons is a perfect example of the turnaround in brick-and-mortar bookselling,” said James Daunt, CEO, Barnes & Noble. “When our lease ended in 2020, after 26 years of bookselling in our former location, bookstores were closing at an alarming rate. Now, just four years later, we are able to open many beautiful new stores, including those in areas we had previously left.""

Residents have expressed their enthusiasm for the new venture on social media. ""This makes me so happy! People have been messaging me about this news for a few weeks. The community is so excited for your return,"" one resident wrote on Facebook.

Back in 2020, the bookstore shuttered its doors to make way for the brand-new shopping center. At the time, the bookstore decided not to sign on to reopen its site when the Shops at Ledgewood Commons project was finished, instead announcing on social media that they were going to be closing down for good.

However, that decision was rethought, and the company announced that they would be returning to Ledgewood earlier this year.

""It is immensely gratifying to come back to Ledgewood with this stunning new bookstore in such a vibrant, modern shopping center,” Daunt said.

The new site features the widely acclaimed bookshop design found in the most recent Barnes & Noble store openings, as well as all of the best books, toys, games and gifts that consumers have come to expect from the country's leading bookseller.

“We’re so excited to be bringing Barnes & Noble back to Ledgewood,” said store manager Mary Videc. “The new store design is amazing, and the booksellers enthusiastically took on the task of creating a personalized experience for our community. The outpouring of support from local readers upon hearing news of our return has been overwhelming, and we can’t wait to welcome them into their new Ledgewood Barnes & Noble.”

The new location will also not have a music section, similar to the Morris Plains location, the company said. The bookshop will also not have a café on the premises, although there is a Starbucks across the street, officials said.",https://patch.com/new-jersey/morristown/new-barnes-noble-opens-morris-county-former-ledgewood-mall,real,0

"This might be why the RTX 4090 is getting so expensive.

In recent weeks, the gaming community has been buzzing with discussions and concerns over the skyrocketing prices of the highly anticipated RTX 4090 graphics card. As enthusiasts eagerly await the release of this powerhouse GPU, a closer look at the market dynamics reveals a combination of factors contributing to the unprecedented surge in its cost.

1. Unprecedented Demand:
The demand for high-performance graphics cards, driven primarily by the gaming and cryptocurrency mining communities, has reached new heights. The RTX 4090, being the next iteration in NVIDIA's revered lineup, has sparked an unprecedented level of interest. The surge in demand has led to a classic case of supply and demand, with retailers adjusting prices to meet the market's appetite for this cutting-edge hardware.

2. Global Semiconductor Shortages:
The semiconductor industry has been grappling with shortages on a global scale. The production challenges, exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic, have impacted various tech sectors, including graphics card manufacturing. As a result, the scarcity of key components has contributed to increased production costs, which are often passed on to consumers.

3. Advanced Technology and Features:
The RTX 4090 is expected to boast groundbreaking technological advancements, offering unparalleled performance and features. The incorporation of cutting-edge technologies such as improved ray tracing, higher CUDA core counts, and enhanced memory configurations inevitably raises production costs. As consumers demand more powerful and feature-rich GPUs, manufacturers are faced with the challenge of delivering these advancements while maintaining affordability.

4. Inflation and Economic Factors:
Global economic conditions, including inflation and fluctuations in currency values, play a role in determining the final retail price of products. As costs rise across various industries, manufacturers may adjust pricing to account for these economic factors. The RTX 4090, being a premium product, is not immune to the broader economic landscape.

5. Scalping and Secondary Market Dynamics:
The reselling market, driven by scalpers and opportunistic sellers, further amplifies the pricing challenges. Limited stock availability combined with high demand creates an environment where secondary marketplaces thrive. Resellers, taking advantage of the scarcity, often inflate prices beyond the recommended retail prices, contributing to the perception of an overall price surge.

While the exact combination of these factors may vary, it is evident that a confluence of market dynamics is contributing to the rising costs of the RTX 4090. As consumers eagerly await the opportunity to experience the next level of gaming performance, they are left navigating a landscape where the price of cutting-edge technology comes at a premium. As the industry adapts to these challenges, enthusiasts remain hopeful for a future where the RTX 4090 and similar high-performance GPUs become more accessible to all.",generate a news article for the title: This might be why the RTX 4090 is getting so expensive,fake,1
"This might be why the RTX 4090 is getting so expensive.

The RTX 4090, despite being one of the best graphics cards you can buy, has been the center of controversy over the last few months. The powerful consumer graphics card has seen price increases while GPU prices seem to be falling elsewhere, and we might finally know why.

Thousands of RTX 4090 graphics cards are being repurposed as AI chips in China, reports Wccftech. Just days before the report, a ban on AI chips sold to China from the U.S. went into effect, which includes the RTX 4090. The report states that Nvidia prioritized “a large chunk” of RTX 4090 graphics cards to China a few days before the ban went into effect.

If that’s true, it’s clear what the impact is on GPU prices in the States. Prices on the RTX 4090 have continued to rise over the past several weeks. Now, even among Black Friday deals, you can’t find any card new for under $2,000. The card originally launched for $1,600, and Nvidia’s other high-end GPUs, such as the RTX 4080, are commonly selling below list price.

With more allocation of these cards going to China prior to the ban, that could have an impact on prices in other regions if there isn’t enough supply. Wccftech reports that the cards are being repurposed for AI machines, but that really doesn’t matter. If a large number of RTX 4090s move from one region to another, and there’s limited supply, the price in other regions will go up.

Before the doom and gloom of a GPU shortage sets in, though, this isn’t likely to snowball into a craze similar to crypto mining. Price increases are solely impacting the RTX 4090, and now that a ban is in place, new cards using the AD102 chip that the RTX 4090 packs should lower pricing as inventory increases.

On top of that, Nvidia is rumored to announce several new GPUs in January. The reported Super refresh will bring performance bumps to the RTX 4070, RTX 4070 Ti, and RTX 4080. As of right now, it doesn’t appear the RTX 4090 will get the Super treatment. That means Nvidia intends to continue selling the GPU, so prices shouldn’t stay high for long.

Although this is a possible explanation, it’s not concrete. Wccftech’s source is the Baidu Forums, and the thread it cites includes several uses speculating that the photos are fake or misrepresented. It’s clear something is going on with the RTX 4090, however, and given the card’s AI prowess in Nvidia’s current consumer lineup and the fact that it’s the only card seeing price increases, it doesn’t seem far-fetched.

Hopefully, the price increases are just temporary. Now that the ban is in effect and we’re heading toward January when Nvidia is expected to announce new GPUs, we should see how GPU prices stabilize in the next few months.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-rtx-4090-is-so-expensive/,real,0

"3 rich neighborhoods in Seoul rank lowest in cancer mortality.

Among Seoul's 25 districts, also known as “gu” in Korea, three affluent neighborhoods—Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, and Songpa-gu—exhibited the lowest cancer mortality rate from 2019 to 2021, a report showed.


According to a report by the Seoul Medical Foundation, individuals residing north of the Han River exhibited a cancer mortality rate that was higher than those living south of the river. 
Based on the findings of the ""2022 Seoul Health Disparity Monitoring Report"" published by the Seoul Health Foundation, Gangnam-gu exhibited the lowest cancer mortality rate among the districts of Seoul between 2019 and 2021, recording 71 deaths per 100,000 individuals. This was succeeded by Seocho-gu (71.1) and Songpa-gu (74.6).

The three districts also ranked low in cancer mortality by the type of cancer, including lung and liver cancer.

Seocho-gu had the lowest lung cancer mortality rate with 12.3 per 100,000 people, followed by Songpa-gu (13.8), and Gangnam-gu (14.3). 

Liver cancer mortality rates were also lower in Gangnam-gu (7.6), Seocho-gu (7.7), and Songpa-gu (9.1).

In that same timeframe, the majority of districts situated north of the Han River displayed a greater cancer mortality rate compared to districts located south of the river. Notably, Gangbuk-gu registered the highest cancer mortality rate among Seoul’s 25 districts, with 94.8 deaths per 100,000 individuals, followed by Jungnang-gu (93.2) and Dongdaemun-gu (90.4).

The overall average cancer mortality rate for Seoul was 84 deaths per 100,000 individuals. When examined by gender, the cancer mortality rate in men (111.2) was approximately double that of women (56.8).

The report attributed these varying outcomes primarily to lifestyle factors. Notably, the prevalence of smoking, measured among approximately 900 individuals in each district in 2021, was elevated in districts situated north of the Han River. Jungnang-gu exhibited the highest percentage of smokers within its district at 19.6 percent, followed by Yangcheon-gu (18.7 percent) and Gangbuk-gu (18.2 percent). Across Seoul as a whole, the overall smoking rate was 15.7 percent.

Residents of districts located north of the Han River also demonstrated a higher rate of alcohol consumption.

In terms of the percentage of heavy drinkers, Gangbuk-gu held the top position with 13.4 percent, followed by Geumcheon-gu at 13.2 percent. The report defined heavy drinkers as individuals who consumed seven or more shots in a single sitting (for men) or five or more shots per sitting (for women) or those who drank on more than two occasions in a week. The average for Seoul was 9.1 percent.

The report additionally revealed an increase in the occurrence of depression among Seoul residents aged 19 and above. This group experienced feelings of sadness or hopelessness that disrupted their daily routines for more than two consecutive weeks within the past year. The prevalence of such cases rose from 6.5 percent in 2019 to 6.8 percent in 2021.

"Ferry wasn't hit by bulk carrier; it capsized due to water seepage: survivors.

The Rajanigandha ferry capsized in the Padma due to water seeping in through a hole, not because it was hit by any bulk carrier, survivors of the accident in Paturia said.

Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) officials and some witnesses initially said the ferry capsized after being hit by a bulk carrier this morning.

Ashique Sheikh, a driver of a cotton-laden truck who was travelling to Gazipur from Kushtia, said, ""The ferry was anchored in the river due to fog and we were waiting for it to clear. An employee of the ferry shouted at us to jump into the river saying water was entering the vessel.

""They did not even provide any life jacket or other equipment to save our lives. I jumped into the water to save my life,"" he told The Daily Star, adding that he was rescued by locals later. 

Sajjad Ali, another trucker, recounted the harrowing experience in similar terms.

""The ferry was stranded around 1:30am and some people said it was stuck in a hidden shoal but later we came to know that the service stopped due to heavy fog.

""We remained on the ferry until one of its crew members informed us that the vessel was capsizing. The ferry slowly submerged as water filled it,"" he said adding there was no collision.

The Rajanigandha, the ferry that runs on the Daulatdia-Paturia route, capsized less than a half kilometre from terminal-5 around 8:15am. One crew member -- the second master of the ferry, Humayun Kabir, 39 -- remains missing as off filing the report around 4:15pm.

Contacted, Deputy General Manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation's (BIWTC's) Aricha regional office Shah Md Khaled Newaz said they initially heard that the ferry sunk after being hit by a bulk carrier.

""We formed a five-member committee to investigate the incident.

"Ferry wasn't hit by bulk carrier; it capsized due to water seepage: survivors.

DHAKA, Bangladesh - Survivors of the ferry that capsized in Bangladesh on Monday claim the vessel capsized due to water seepage and was not hit by a bulk carrier as initially reported.
The double-decker passenger ferry was carrying over 100 passengers when it capsized in the Buriganga River near the capital Dhaka. Initial reports suggested the ferry was hit by a bulk carrier, causing it to tip over.
However, survivors who were pulled from the river say the ferry started taking on water rapidly about 10 minutes after departing the Sadarghat terminal in Old Dhaka.
""We felt the ferry was sitting low in the water and listing to the right side,"" said Rafiqul Islam, one of the survivors. ""The crew tried to stabilize it but water was gushing in from somewhere.""
Other survivors reported hearing loud banging sounds below deck, indicating that water was flooding into hull compartments. As the ferry tipped farther, passengers started panicking and jumping overboard.
""I do not believe it was hit by another boat,"" said survivor Shefali Begum. ""This happened due to water entering the ferry from below. It sank very fast, within minutes.""
Recovery crews have retrieved over 50 bodies so far as they continue searching the muddy river for additional victims. The ferry was carrying over twice its rated passenger capacity of 85, which likely contributed to its fateful capsizing.
Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the incident. Improving Bangladesh's extensive ferry system and enacting stricter safety standards is once again under intense public scrutiny after this week's disaster.","Create a news article titled ""Ferry wasn't hit by bulk carrier; it capsized due to water seepage: survivors""",fake,1
"Residents share their priorities for the 2024 legislative session.

Fairfax County’s delegation to the General Assembly held a public hearing on Jan. 6 about residents’ interests for the 2024 legislative session. 

The delegation heard from many speakers who highlighted various issues ranging from education issues to disability services and concerns related to affordable housing.

Education funding is a major issue for the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and School Board. Board of Supervisors Chair Jeffrey McKay highlighted the need for renewed K-12 education funding throughout the state.

“We know that $19,000 per student underfunding exists in the Commonwealth of Virginia and that nearly all of Virginia’s neighboring states spend more per pupil on public education funding, including West Virginia and Kentucky than Virginia does,” said McKay.

Fairfax County School Board Chair Karl Frisch criticized Governor Glenn Youngkin’s inaction on this issue.

“It appears our governor seems content with allowing Kentucky and West Virginia to continue outpacing Virginia when it comes to education funding for K-12,” said Frisch. “The governor’s proposed budget has no proposals whatsoever to address the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission’s recommendations for public education funding.”

Frisch also criticized the governor’s decision to introduce the grocery sales tax cut in 2022, and the governor’s proposal to cut spending aimed towards replacing public education funding originally garnered through the grocery sales tax.

However, the Youngkin administration announced this week that he would back a bipartisan overhaul of the education system to ensure it works for all students attending.

“Governor Youngkin has introduced the largest per-student investment in the history of the Commonwealth. Virginia has infused a record investment into our education system but the convoluted and outdated K-12 funding formula that was developed back in the 1980s makes it complicated to navigate and lacks transparency,” said Christian Martinez a spokesman for the governor. “On top of the formula, state mandates leave our school superintendents with very little autonomy to ensure dollars are truly working for the students. This is why the Governor invited school superintendents and school business officials to work together with the Department of Education to provide a plan for the K-12 funding formula that focuses on students and prioritizes resources by student needs so that every Virginia student can receive the quality education they deserve.”

In contrast, the president of the Fairfax County Taxpayers Alliance, Arthur Purves, argued that increasing spending has not solved problems related to illiteracy.

 “More money will not fix this problem. The problem is not race, not students, nor money. The problem is bad curricula and unaccountable administrators,” said Purves.

Disability services were another issue on the minds of county residents. Dennis Findley, a McLean resident with a 28-year-old son living with intellectual disabilities, discussed the benefit of his son working a job without losing his Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).

“My son loves being out in the world. One that he understands in his own unique way. However, one thing he understands, just like you and me, is that working at a job gives meaning to life,” said Findley.

However, according to Findley, the additional social security benefit his son receives following his mother’s passing impedes him from being able to get a job without losing his disability benefits. He also emphasized that other disabled residents with Social Security benefits above the state’s income limit currently lose their coverage entirely.

Findley urged the delegation to support a bill sponsored by Delegates Irene Shin (D-Fairfax) and Vivian Watts (D-Annandale), which would allow parent survivor income to be disregarded from Medicaid eligibility while continuing to provide disabled patients coverage for co-pays.

Springfield resident Lindsay Latham additionally brought concerns surrounding caregiver access for families with disabled children to the delegation’s attention.

“Parents need more flexibility, not more restrictions,” said Latham. “We have to start looking now for an attendant to apply for [summer] coverage for our son [because] it will take four to five months to get them on payroll. Based on our track record in trying to find attendants, I have little hope that this will be resolved, and we, too, will be panicking and scrambling as summer vacation starts.”

Latham pleaded with the delegation to prioritize families like hers who want to be able to work full-time and find adequate support for their children during school breaks.

Other residents and community organizers spoke about Fairfax County’s housing cost. Fairfax resident Nermin Abdelwahab shared a personal story about her own housing situation.

“My parents had newly immigrated to the U.S., and they had purchased a house right outside of Fairfax City in the Woodson district. I am so lucky that house was purchased,” said Abdelwahab. “Me and my husband cannot have purchased that house today. We couldn’t have purchased that house in 2016 when we were looking.”

Despite being more professionally successful than her parents could have ever imagined, she is deeply concerned about the cost of living in the region as she would struggle to buy a house in the county by herself. Abdelwahab called on the delegation to address problems with the area’s high housing costs.

Cornerstones CEO Kerrie Wilson also emphasized the need to address housing costs and provide additional services to low-income residents.

“In the 40 years that I’ve been working on health and human service issues, I have never seen such a time of greatest need,” said Wilson. 

Other residents, such as Reston resident Camron Wilson, shared concerns regarding the proposal to construct a new casino in Reston or Tysons Corner.

“I’d like to emphasize the unique character and vision that our community has upheld for decades,” said Wilson. “Sadly, the proposal to introduce a casino in Reston, or anywhere in Fairfax County, threatens to undermine the very foundation upon which our community stands.”

Wilson pointed to increased rates of addiction, financial instability, and crime as problems with casinos in any given community.

High school student Ariya Lee expressed her interest in including climate change education in Virginia’s public school curriculum.

“By the time I graduate high school, the effects of climate change will be well on their way to being irreversible,” said Lee. “But for such a bad situation, I wasn’t taught about climate change in school. I was lucky enough to have the time and resources to research it in my own time, but how many students are moving on with their lives without any idea what climate change is?”

 While it is unclear if all these concerns will be addressed, McKay’s and Frisch’s comments about public education funding and Findley’s concerns about SSDI eligibility received applause from the delegation.",https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/fairfax_county/residents-share-their-priorities-for-the-2024-legislative-session/article_9aa8e8f2-b0ae-11ee-bc15-4fadfaed6532.html,real,0

A Democratic shake-up in the Mon Valley may bring new faces but familiar names to political office

In a surprising turn of events, the Mon Valley is gearing up for a political shake-up as the Democratic Party welcomes a wave of fresh faces alongside some familiar names. The upcoming political season promises to be one of change and innovation as the community prepares for new leadership.

Amidst the anticipation, a slew of dynamic candidates is emerging, each vying for a chance to make a lasting impact on the Mon Valley's political landscape. From grassroots activists to seasoned politicians, the Democratic primaries are becoming a hotbed of diversity and enthusiasm.

While the introduction of new blood is palpable, some familiar names are making a return to the political arena, bringing with them a wealth of experience and a legacy deeply rooted in the Mon Valley. These seasoned campaigners believe that their extensive knowledge of local issues positions them as ideal candidates to navigate the challenges facing the community.

The Mon Valley, known for its industrial heritage and resilient spirit, has long been a stronghold for the Democratic Party. As the electoral landscape evolves, there is a growing sense that the community is ready for a new chapter, one that blends the wisdom of seasoned leaders with the fresh perspectives of emerging voices.

Political analysts are closely monitoring the developments, predicting that the Democratic shake-up in the Mon Valley may result in a more dynamic and responsive government. The combination of new faces and familiar names could usher in an era of collaborative governance, where the strengths of both veterans and rookies are harnessed for the benefit of the community.

The local electorate is expressing excitement at the prospect of this political transformation, eagerly anticipating the upcoming primaries and general election. As candidates engage in spirited debates and outreach efforts, the Mon Valley is abuzz with discussions about the future trajectory of its political representation.

In the coming weeks, voters will have the opportunity to cast their ballots and shape the destiny of the Mon Valley. The Democratic shake-up promises not only a change in leadership but also a renewed sense of hope and optimism for a community looking towards a brighter future.","Write a news article with the following title ""A Democratic shake-up in the Mon Valley may bring new faces but familiar names to political office""",fake,1
"A Democratic shake-up in the Mon Valley may bring new faces but familiar names to political office.

By now, “Democrats in disarray” headlines have become a running political joke, one almost as familiar as Will Rogers’ observation that as a Democrat, he was not a member of an organized political party. But some Democrats in the Mon Valley, at least, seem very much in array this week — so much so that critics are grousing about that instead.

Put simply: There haven’t been this many moving parts in the Valley since they shut down the Homestead Works.

Late Wednesday, state Sen. and former McKeesport Mayor Jim Brewster announced that he will not run for re-election in the 45th district, which he’s held since 2010 and which ranges from the Valley to the South Hills and Monroeville. That was followed Thursday morning by news that state Rep. Nick Pisciottano would seek the seat, with backing from Brewster and a broad swath of other Democratic leaders.

A few hours after that, Pisciottano backed a candidate to replace him in his 38th House District seat next year: West Mifflin educator and borough council member John Inglis.

“If you’re looking for someone who’s dedicated, someone that truly cares and would be authentic in this political arena, it’s me,” Inglis told me.

And in a district that used to elect more socially conservative Democrats like Pisciottano’s predecessor Bill Kortz, Inglis and Pisciottano both support abortion rights.

It’s part of a generational change in leadership that I’ve babbled about before. And the Mon Valley has more than played its part in it. Summer Lee and Austin Davis both were elected to House seats here and went on to become the state’s first Black congresswoman and lieutenant governor, respectively. Pisciottano’s election in 2020 didn’t mark the same kind of shift, but since taking office, he’s pulled off the rare feat of appealing both to party progressives and the party’s old guard.

Pisciottano said part of the shift stems from “a lost generation” of leadership after the collapse of Big Steel. That magnified a nationwide dearth of office-eligible Gen Xers, or at least Gen Xers ambitious enough to do more than write political newsletters.

But one consequence of those departures — and the strong family ties that have kept some anchored to the area — is that as more than one observer has told me, “Everyone still living here is related somehow.”

Inglis, for one, is Pisciottano’s cousin, and he may face a challenger who also sports a familiar West Mifflin name. Andrew “AJ” Olasz says he will run for the seat that was once held by his grandfather, Richard D. Olasz. (Olasz’ father, meanwhile, is a magistrate district judge in the area.)

“It’s always been a dream of mine to run for that seat, and this is the time,” said Olasz, who works for the law firm of Dodaro, Matta and Cambest. He said he plans to formally announce his campaign next week.

To be sure, such family traditions extend beyond the 38th district: Matthew Gergely, who represents District 35 next door, is the brother of Marc Gergely, who once held the seat. Brandon Markosek inherited a House seat from his father in the 25th District seat just down the road.

And don’t be surprised if another candidate jumps into these races. Both Brewster’s and Pisciottano’s districts include South HIlls communities where some Democrats rankle at the thought of being represented by another Mon Valley pol. (West Mifflin in particular has long dominated the seat: The elder Olasz and his successor Kenneth Ruffing were both from the area and between them held it for a quarter-century. Bill Kortz of Dravosburg represented the area between 2006 and 2020.)

I’ve already heard grumbling from some Democrats about how Brewster, Pisciottano and Inglis’ announcements have been orchestrated. All of these developments, after all, took place not long before a 5 p.m. Friday deadline for candidates who want to seek the Allegheny County Democratic Committee endorsement. And while candidates can and do win without the party’s backing — Lee took down a member of the Costa family in just that way — it’s an option they may want to consider.

Republicans seized on the timing Wednesday, issuing a statement decrying the “Mon Valley politics” that sought to make Pisciottano the “hand-picked successor” of Brewster.

Notably, the GOP hasn’t put their candidate forward either, though their statement pledges, “We will have a candidate that presents voters with a real choice.” (Presumably, that candidate won’t be “hand-picked.”)

In any case, there is already an alternative for the Brewster seat: social worker and community activist Makenzie White. And Democrats have more time to weigh their chances than they did in, say, 2018, when Markosek ran to replace his father. The elder Markosek didn’t disclose his retirement until his son filed for the party endorsement … and after the deadline for anyone else to do so.

Brewster denies there was an effort to box anyone out. If anything, he said, “You have to make these announcements because petitions [to run for office] come out in a week or so, and it’s not fair to the public. People that want to run should get the petitions and circulate them.”

Which is good advice. Just give the political reporters a few days to catch their breaths, OK?

"Understanding the economic crisis: Corruption a symptom, not the root cause.

The most common rationalisation of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is to blame corruption, which is a complete mischaracterisation. This is not to say that corruption had no part in the crisis, but to place the blame solely on corruption would be inaccurate. In my view, there has been an economic policy problem which incentivised corruption, hence that is a problem that we have to fix, rather than trying to fix corruption. Corruption is just a symptom and policy is the root cause.

However, policy problems cannot be analysed in a vacuum, because simply having a policy does not mean everything will be alright. Policy has to be analysed based on the strength and stability of institutions.

One good example is the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No.3 of 2003. According to the act (policy), the Government cannot exceed the budget deficit above 5% of the GDP. Since the act has enacted every budget we have presented, our budget deficit has been above 5%. Nothing has happened to any government for violating their own rules. We have the policy, but we do not have the institutions to enforce it or the stability or capacity for institutions to abide by the policy.

The anti-corruption commision is another good example. Many countries that wished to eradicate corruption have set up anti-corruption units, but when anti-corruption units are also corrupt, since they have been established by the existing powers, it is self-defeating.

Therefore, thinking that we can avoid an economic crisis or overcome the crisis by focusing on corruption as the sole measure shows a lack of depth. We have to evaluate the system somewhat more broadly to fix it.

A common question people ask is, “where are the assets for the loans we have taken?”. In that case, people think we have taken loans and syphoned that money out without investing. The deficit of the value of the projects and the loans we have taken is generally considered to be that which has been spent on corruption. While there have definitely been kickbacks from the projects, most of the money we have borrowed has been borrowed not for projects but to pay the interests of the loans we had borrowed before.

From our debt, about 74% has been used to pay interest or for exchange depreciation (40% for interest and 33% for currency depreciation). Since 1999, most of our debt has gone towards bad policies in the form of interest and for the exchange rate. At the point of borrowing money, similar to what happened in the Central Bank bond scam, there can be corruption, but the corruption is often an outcome of a bad policy or a poor system rather than a standalone problem.

Thus, rather than thinking about jailing the corrupt, it is easier to fill the gaps in the system where corruption takes place. This is where a market system is needed. The market system has the power to make the players of corruption uncompetitive, because corruption is costly. When the cost is too high, provided the consumer has a choice, they can shift to alternatives. Therefore, it is vitally important to set the market system straight and keep entry and exit barriers at a minimum.

Framework of the market system to think about corruption

How do we decide the project?
Generally, corruption takes place in projects and the decision-making processes of the projects. These mainly come as unsolicited proposals. Someone proposing a solution for a problem that even the government is unaware of falls under the category of unsolicited proposals. The government has the discretionary power to decide which projects are to be done and which projects are to be set aside. This is how quite a lot of construction projects, instead of education and healthcare, get priority.

Most projects under SOEs also fall under this category, which is why SOEs are considered vehicles of corruption and SOE reform is a must. Adhering to the National Physical Plan and getting it through Parliament is one way to minimise it.

Who does the project?
When the project is decided, the selection of the implementation partner is the next window for corruption. Again, it can be awarded through unsolicited proposals or there can be technical corruption where the specifications of the supplies are in favour of a selected supplier.

Unsolicited and competitive processes violate the market system, and on a technical level, corruption is very hard to detect even at the legal stage. However, with an open process on complaints and reevaluation, there is still room for improvement. There are also cases where even the competitive process is established due to a lack of trust in the system; the most suitable person doesn’t want to apply and go through the process.

Deciding on the price
The other point of corruption is when it comes to deciding on the price. It could be the interest rates on bonds, the contract value, or the price of the energy purchase. Price discovery is also a market-based process. When prices are allowed to be set without a market-based approach, there is room for corruption. That is how most of the energy agreements were signed and we borrowed money to pay the price. Rather than trying to fix the individual involved in corruption because the next person could repeat these same actions, it is advisable to fix the problem first.

Deciding the quality of materials
The fourth case is where even the people selected through the competitive process simply use inferior quality products. Our experiences in poor quality medicine at the Ministry of Health is just one example.

Corruption can take place in projects or in processes based on any of the above or a combination of any of the four. However, this takes place only when the decision-making power or discretionary power is given to someone who is not the owner of the risk or the investment. Otherwise, it leaves competition out or maintains information asymmetry for someone to benefit from.

In a market system where competition is given priority and prices are allowed to reflect the scarcity value of money, it naturally leaves corruption behind, but creating the information balance is not easy.

Therefore, while no market or government is perfect, a market system is a better system to avoid corruption, rather than expecting the government to eradicate corruption, since the government has no interest or incentive to do business or to eradicate corruption.

It is not about the private sector versus the government – it is all about a market system which incentivises transparency and minimises room for corruption. Our continuous failure to build that system was the reason for our fall (economic crisis) and we can only overcome it by fixing it, since it is the root cause, and not by fixing the symptom called corruption.",https://www.themorning.lk/articles/oujhZ2OfMVloEMoBe1cV?s=09&utm_source=pocket_saves,real,0
"Understanding the economic crisis: Corruption a symptom, not the root cause.

As Sri Lanka navigates its current economic hardship, a familiar foe rears its head: corruption. Fingers are pointed, blame assigned, and promises of ""cleaning up"" abound. But while addressing corruption is crucial, it's imperative we understand it not as the main villain, but as a symptom of a deeper ailment.

Focusing solely on corruption risks obscuring the underlying systemic issues that foster it. Sri Lanka's economic model, heavily reliant on imports and tourism, proved brittle in the face of global shocks. A bloated public sector, inefficient bureaucracy, and inadequate export diversification further exacerbated the situation. These are the cracks in the foundation, allowing the pernicious weed of corruption to take root.

Corruption thrives in the shadows – in opaque regulations, discretionary powers, and weak oversight. A system designed for rent-seeking, favors vested interests over public good. Addressing these systemic vulnerabilities is fundamental to preventing future crises, not just catching individual culprits.

This means prioritizing transparency and accountability, empowering independent institutions like the judiciary and media, and streamlining regulations to reduce discretionary power. Investing in education and healthcare fosters an informed and engaged citizenry, less susceptible to manipulation. Diversifying the economy and promoting exports builds resilience to external shocks.

Of course, tackling corruption remains crucial. But it must be pursued strategically, as part of a broader reform agenda. Harsher punishments alone offer limited efficacy if the breeding ground persists. Root and branch reforms are needed to create an environment where honesty is not just rewarded, but becomes the natural order of things.

Blaming everything on corruption risks falling into a simplistic trap. It demonizes individuals while neglecting the systemic conditions that breed such practices. True anti-corruption efforts must address the factors that make it easy and even profitable to be dishonest.

The road to recovery is long and arduous. But by tackling the systemic weaknesses that allow corruption to flourish, we can build a more resilient and equitable Sri Lanka. Focusing solely on catching individual culprits, while necessary, offers only a temporary fix. Let's address the root causes, not just the symptoms, and emerge from this crisis with a stronger, fairer, and more prosperous nation.

This is not just an economic imperative, but a moral one. It's about building a Sri Lanka where the fruits of hard work, not connections and bribes, determine success. It's about creating a system that truly serves the people, not the privileged few. This is the true challenge before us, and it's one we must rise to meet together, with clear eyes and unwavering resolve.

Let's not let the smoke of corruption obscure the deeper fire.

The Berwyn School District has announced that it will include the infamous Berwyn School Fight of 2022 in its history and social studies courses starting from the next academic year. The decision comes after a petition by students, parents, and teachers who argued that the fight was a pivotal moment in the local community and the nation.

The Berwyn School Fight was a violent confrontation that took place on April 15, 2022, between two groups of students from rival schools: Berwyn High School and Oakwood High School. The fight erupted after a heated exchange on social media over a basketball game that Berwyn High School had won by a narrow margin. The fight involved over 200 students and lasted for more than an hour, resulting in several injuries and arrests. The fight also sparked a wider debate on issues such as school safety, bullying, racism, and social media.

The Berwyn School District said that it will use the fight as a case study to teach students about the causes and consequences of violence, the role of media and technology in shaping public opinion, and the importance of dialogue and tolerance in resolving conflicts. The district also said that it will invite speakers from both schools, as well as experts and activists, to share their perspectives and experiences with the students.

The announcement was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some praised the district for taking a bold and innovative step to educate students about a relevant and controversial topic. Others criticized the district for glorifying and sensationalizing a shameful and tragic incident. Some also expressed concern that the inclusion of the fight in the curricula might reignite tensions and animosities between the two schools.

The district said that it will monitor and evaluate the impact of the new curricula on the students’ learning outcomes and behavior, and make adjustments as needed. It also said that it will seek feedback from the students, parents, teachers, and the community throughout the process. The district hopes that the new curricula will help students learn from the past and prevent future violence.","Generate a news article with the following title: ""Berwyn School Fight added to curricula""",fake,1
"Berwyn School Fight added to curricula.

Beginning this year, TESD officially added the district's Berwyn School Fight in the 1930s to its third, eighth and 10th grade social studies curricula. 

With the addition, students in those grades will learn about the history of the district’s decision in 1932 to segregate its schools and the local Black community's legal battles through. out the following two years to eventually reverse the change.

The addition to curricula will also focus on where students can see remnants of this history around the district. For example, the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Devon was one of several local meeting places community leaders used to plan how they would fight the school board's decision and return to integrated schooling.

As a result of this curricula change, students will first gain exposure to this topic in third grade and progressively delve deeper into the history in eighth and 10th grades.

""Our goal is to really give students the appropriate background information that they need to be able to understand these events, so this is their first introduction to it,"" said Dr. Matthew Sterenczak, TESD curriculum supervisor for social studies. ""It's not just teaching the school fight, but it's also this idea of discrimination.""

In eighth grade, students will revisit the topic to focus on the perspectives of the people involved in the Berwyn School Fight.

In 10th grade U.S. History classes, high schoolers will dive deeper into the circumstances that enabled Black community members to fight segregation in the Berwyn School Fight. The additions to the curricula aim to push students to draw deeper connections from history to the T/E community today.

""It's to honor and understand the legacy of the people that made this community what it is today,"" Sterenczak said. ""As communities evolve and shift and change, it's always important to understand what was here before and what are the stories that shaped this community and still have an impact in this community.""

Prior to the official curricula implementation this year, some teachers in the middle schools and Conestoga already independently incorporated parts of this history into their lessons. Freshman Sukanya Menon, a member of the Student Leaders' Antiracist Movement club and student member of the school board diversity committee, first learned about this part of local history in her social studies class last year.

""Honestly, I was really shocked, considering (my experience) as a student in the district right now and how inclusive we are,"" Menon said. ""To see the district in such a different position was really shocking for me, especially because it wasn't even brought to my attention until I was an eighth grader. I was kind of caught off guard.""

Many T/E students, like Menon, first learned about the Berwyn School Fight in middle or high school. The topic remained largely unmentioned at the elementary school level due to the lack of an official curriculum for it.

By including the Berwyn School Fight in third grade social studies classes, Sterenczak hopes that students in the district will learn about it earlier and spend more time building on their knowledge and understanding of it as they get older.

""We want all students to be able to have this experience. We want to deliver it age appropriately. We want to align with our curriculum, but we also want students to be able to understand that this is an important part of history,"" Sterenczak said. ""The goal was to make sure that we can revisit it to highlight its importance and to build upon the knowledge that we have.""",https://issuu.com/stoganews/docs/issue_3,real,0

"Proposed improvement program in Vernon Hills includes master plan for bikes, pedestrians.

Introduction:
Vernon Hills, a vibrant community known for its picturesque landscapes and thriving neighborhoods, is gearing up for a transformative change. A proposed improvement program is set to reshape the town's infrastructure, focusing on enhancing accessibility and promoting sustainable modes of transportation.

Parks, shopping districts, and recreational areas will be reimagined to prioritize pedestrians, contributing to a healthier and more vibrant community.

Green Corridors: The master plan introduces green corridors—lush, landscaped pathways designed to provide a scenic and environmentally friendly route for both pedestrians and cyclists. These corridors will not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the town but also contribute to improved air quality.

Community Engagement: The success of this program relies on active community participation. Town hall meetings, surveys, and workshops will be organized to gather feedback from residents. This inclusive approach ensures that the master plan is reflective of the needs and aspirations of the people it serves.

Benefits for Residents:
Residents stand to gain numerous benefits from this proposed improvement program. Beyond the obvious advantages of improved safety and accessibility, the initiative is expected to boost property values, promote healthier lifestyles, and reduce the town's carbon footprint. By embracing a more sustainable and community-centric approach, Vernon Hills is poised to become a model for towns seeking holistic urban development.

Conclusion:
The proposed improvement program, with its visionary master plan for bikes and pedestrians, signifies a bold step towards a brighter and more sustainable future for Vernon Hills.

"Proposed improvement program in Vernon Hills includes master plan for bikes, pedestrians.

Updating bike and pedestrian plans and creating a master plan for Harvey Lake are among the projects being suggested for Vernon Hills’ five-year capital improvement plan.

The latest draft of the plan, updated every year, calls for expenditures of about $21 million over the next five years. Projects are targeted for various categories including streets, preventive maintenance, traffic signals and streetlights, open space/stormwater and village facilities.

About $4.7 million is suggested for the 2024-25 fiscal year, beginning May 1. Projects are identified by village staff and observations from the board or other public agencies. They are subject to change before being considered as part of the village’s budgeting process.

“We take all this feedback throughout the year, bring it all together and come up with our capital improvement program,” said Chris Venatta, public works director/village engineer.

Venatta outlined a draft of the plan for the village board Tuesday during an informal work session.

The largest categories are streets and right of way at $1.74 million, followed by village facility improvements spanning 16 separate projects at $1.45 million.

The largest single expense in all categories is $1.5 million for the annual road rehabilitation program.

Also in that category is $75,000 for a bike and pedestrian master plan.

Venatta said this is important given sustainability goals as well as ongoing development at the Hawthorn mall property on the north side of Route 60.

“Right now, there’s no pedestrian crossing on Route 60 between Lakeview Parkway and Milwaukee Avenue,” he said. “Especially with the new residential going in at Hawthorn, we really want to look at how can we get people across Route 60.”

In the open space and stormwater category, a $250,000 match to a state grant is suggested for work associated with planning for the restoration of the Seavey Drainage Ditch from Hazeltime Drive to Lake Charles.

Another suggestion is $120,000 for a Harvey Lake master plan. The village previously received a grant to restore a portion of the shoreline of the 14.5-acre artificial lake between Century Park and Hawthorn mall.

“What we're proposing here is a comprehensive master plan of how the village sees this asset moving forward in the future,” Venatta said.

The first budget review session is planned for the March 5 village board meeting.",https://www.dailyherald.com/20240110/news/proposed-improvement-program-in-vernon-hills-includes-master-plan-for-bikes-pedestrians/,real,0
"Bay Bridge cease-fire protesters rally against charges.

Dozens of protesters who halted traffic on the Bay Bridge to call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war are now asking the district attorney to drop the charges against them.

The protesters, who call themselves the Bay Bridge 78, were arrested in November for shutting down the Bay Bridge for four hours during the week of APEC in San Francisco.

""We know that being on the bridge caused a lot of news, ruckus throughout the world,"" Nadya Tannous said. ""We're glad that that message of cease-fire and ending U.S. aid to Israel reached the people.""

The protesters each face five charges, including false imprisonment, refusing to comply with an officer and refusing to disperse.

The protestors, some of whom were arraigned last month, say the charges are trumped up, calling them egregious, specifically when it comes to the charge of false imprisonment.

Title: Bay Bridge Cease-Fire Protesters Rally Against Charges

Date: January 17, 2024

Location: San Francisco, CA

Content:

In a remarkable display of civil engagement, a large group of protesters, who had previously organized a peaceful cease-fire demonstration on the Bay Bridge, gathered again today. This time, their cause was to rally against the charges levied against them following their initial protest.

The Bay Bridge, a critical artery for San Francisco's traffic, had been the site of a dramatic yet peaceful protest last month, where demonstrators called for an immediate cease-fire in an ongoing conflict (details of the conflict to be specified based on context). The protesters, forming a human chain across the bridge, garnered national attention, highlighting their call for peace and diplomacy.

However, the aftermath of the protest saw several participants facing charges related to obstructing traffic and public disorder. This response from the authorities sparked a debate on the balance between the right to protest and public order.

Today's rally saw a diverse crowd, with people from various walks of life joining in solidarity with the charged protesters. The demonstrators carried banners and chanted slogans emphasizing the importance of free speech and peaceful protest in a democratic society. They argued that the charges were unjust and an overreaction to a peaceful demonstration.

Legal experts and civil rights activists speaking at the rally highlighted the potential implications of these charges on the right to peaceful assembly. They stressed the need for a legal framework that protects peaceful protesters while ensuring public safety and order.

The local authorities have responded to the rally with a statement, affirming their commitment to upholding the law while respecting the rights of citizens to peaceful protest. They also mentioned that they are open to dialogue with community leaders to find a balanced approach to such situations in the future.

The protest and subsequent rally have sparked a broader conversation in the community and beyond about the nature of protest, civil liberties, and the role of law enforcement in managing public demonstrations.

As the day concluded, the protesters dispersed peacefully, but their message resonated strongly, promising to influence public discourse and policy in the coming days.

"China struggles to spend its way out of economic crisis.

The economic stability of China is increasingly under threat as the country grapples with soaring budget deficits and a rapidly expanding national debt, raising alarms among economists and international financial institutions.

## Fiscal Imbalance Reaches Critical Levels

According to the latest government data, China's budget deficit has ballooned to an unprecedented 15% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a level not seen in decades. 

This fiscal imbalance is primarily driven by a combination of decreased tax revenues and increased government spending, particularly in response to the recent social challenges and infrastructural demands.

The national debt has escalated concurrently, now exceeding 120% of GDP. This alarming figure surpasses the critical threshold that economists like Dr. Helen Markovic, a professor at the Global Economic Institute, consider sustainable. 

""China's debt-to-GDP ratio is entering a danger zone where servicing the debt could become untenable, triggering a cascade of financial crises,"" Dr. Markovic warns.

## Global Economic Downturn Contributes to Fiscal Woes

Several factors contribute to this worrying trend. The global economic downturn has significantly reduced demand for China's main exports, weakening its trade balance.

Domestic policies, including expansive social welfare programs and large-scale infrastructure projects, have also led to increased government expenditure without corresponding revenue growth.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed concern over China's fiscal trajectory.

In a statement, IMF representative Dr. Eduardo Ramirez noted, ""China needs to implement urgent fiscal consolidation measures and structural reforms to restore confidence in its economy and prevent a full-blown financial crisis.""

## Currency Devaluation and Credit Downgrade Loom

Market analysts predict that China's credit rating may face a downgrade, which would increase borrowing costs and further exacerbate the financial strain. 

The central bank's recent attempts to stabilize the currency have had limited success, with the Chinan Dollar continuing to weaken against major currencies.

The government has pledged to introduce austerity measures and seek international assistance to navigate this crisis. 

However, these measures are likely to be unpopular and could lead to social unrest, as cautioned by political analyst Dr. Sarah Lin: ""The government’s response needs to balance fiscal responsibility with social stability. It's a tightrope walk.""

As China confronts these economic challenges, the eyes of the world are on how this once-thriving nation will navigate its way back to financial health and stability.","Try to write a economic news to show that the China is in economic crisis，from the aspect of Budget Deficits and National Debt: News coverage may discuss a country's fiscal health, including government deficits and the growth of national debt.

"China struggles to spend its way out of economic crisis.

This month, China’s new finance minister Lan Fo’an told markets what they had been waiting to hear — Beijing would boost budget spending to support a struggling post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.

China is to deploy an arsenal of local and central government bonds, including a new Rmb1tn ($140bn) treasury facility — which will push Beijing’s budget deficit up to a two-decade high of 3.8 per cent this year, Lan said, to “maintain fiscal spending intensity at an appropriate level”.

But while the message was welcomed by investors, many analysts question just how much budgetary firepower Beijing really has to boost flagging confidence and drive stronger economic momentum.

With economic growth slowing and a previous investment-led development model losing steam, tax revenue is under pressure, analysts said. Beijing is also reluctant to borrow more, given that it has huge pools of bad debt to resolve at the local government level.

“This is the longer-running story — that fiscal policy has been constrained for the last three to four years,” said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group. “[And] it’s becoming more and more constrained in terms of what it can actually do.”

This year, as the economy struggled to rebound from a downturn wrought by zero-Covid controls in 2022 and a property slowdown, the government responded with incremental easing measures. 

China is reluctant to increase leverage as it did after the financial crisis in 2008, when it unleashed a Rmb4tn stimulus then worth 13 per cent of gross domestic product. 


This time around, the central government has not leveraged what, on the face of it, is a relatively clean balance sheet, analysts say. Compared with local governments, which have debt worth about 76 per cent of GDP, the central government had only about 21.3 per cent last year, according to Wright.

“We would argue Beijing has considerable fiscal resources at its disposal,” said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. He said Beijing had room to add more debt worth about 20-30 percentage points of GDP, which would go a long way to solving local government debt problems. 

IMF analysts also said in a paper released in August that China’s net financial position, taking into account its assets such as equity holdings, was among the top 15 in the world, at 7.25 per cent of GDP, though this has been steadily declining and the valuation of the assets were subject to uncertainty because of factors including liquidity.

Most analysts believe, however, that the central government’s real debt obligations are much bigger than the numbers suggest. Beijing acts as the ultimate backstop for the country’s total government debt, estimated by Rhodium’s Wright at 142 per cent of GDP last year, including that held by the central government, policy banks, local governments and local government financing vehicles (LGFV) — off balance sheet entities that raise their own funds.

“In China, the boundaries are a bit blurred,” said Hui Shan, economist at Goldman Sachs, on how to calculate the government’s total debt liabilities. “At what point does an LGFV’s obligations end before they become the responsibility of the local government — it’s hard to draw that line.” 


Resolving local government debt problems has become one of the most urgent issues for Beijing. Upgrading China’s economic growth forecast for this year to 5.4 per cent from 5 per cent, the IMF said that Beijing still needed to “implement co-ordinated fiscal framework reforms”.

Since September, Beijing has been asking state banks to lower interest charges and extend the tenure of local government loans, Gavekal Dragonomics wrote. Beijing has also been allowing provincial governments to issue bonds to repay LGFV debts.

By early November, at least 27 provinces and one municipality had issued Rmb1.2tn of the bonds, which use quotas for local government bond sales that were allocated in previous years but not fully utilised.

By bailing out local governments with another round of bond swaps — the last one was in 2015-18 — the central government was prioritising “preventing risk”, Gavekal said. That meant stopping damaging defaults in the bond market that could have a huge ripple effect. 

This comes at the expense of promoting a sense of moral hazard among local government borrowers. But there are signs Beijing is becoming less demanding on local governments over growth targets, which should lessen the need to overborrow in the future. 

“The message goes out to local government officials that ‘we’re not putting quite as much pressure on you as in the past to achieve exceptionally high rates of growth, so you don’t need the LGFVs as much as in the past’,” said Chris Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal. 


But the central problem of inadequate government revenue generation will still remain, analysts say. Under reforms in 1994, the central government controls tax revenue while local governments are responsible for more services. Short of cash to meet all their obligations, many local governments have typically overborrowed. 

“The fiscal structure is really why we got into this mess. So there needs to be ultimately a change in political incentives, maybe a change in the fiscal structure in order to get us out of it,” said Beddor.

But the other critical problem was that as China’s old debt-fuelled investment model switched towards a more consumption-based one, revenues from land sales and value-added taxes had fallen, particularly as the property market had imploded in recent years.

Aggregate tax collection to GDP is down from 18.5 per cent in 2014 to 13.8 per cent last year, Rhodium’s Wright said.

The Chinese Communist party could increasingly face stark choices about how to balance social and development needs with some of President Xi Jinping’s strategic objectives, such as developing high-tech industries or overseas infrastructure projects.

“There’s a bigger problem of how do you maintain fiscal resources in the system,” Wright said. “And the point is, China faces very meaningful trade-offs between all of these adjustments.”  

China could increase its fiscal deficit further but this was already high at an aggregate 7 per cent of GDP, Wright said. “Yes, you can ramp that up to 8-9 per cent, but then there’s almost nowhere to go,” he said. “It’s really hard to continue to expand.”",https://www.ft.com/content/1dfcdec4-b0fa-4569-a70c-387172a3c241,real,0

"Amid frigid temperatures, overnight fire displaces 8 from Occoquan apartment building.

Occoquan residents faced a challenging night as frigid temperatures compounded the difficulties caused by an overnight fire that displaced eight individuals from a local apartment building. Emergency responders worked tirelessly in harsh conditions to ensure the safety of residents and bring the situation under control.

The fire broke out during the early hours of the morning, sending plumes of smoke into the cold night air. Firefighters from multiple departments rushed to the scene, battling both the flames and the sub-zero temperatures. The icy conditions presented an additional hurdle, making it more challenging for responders to navigate the area and address the emergency.

Residents were evacuated from the apartment building as first responders assessed the situation and worked to contain the fire. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, but the bitter cold made the evacuation process more challenging for both residents and emergency personnel.

Local authorities are investigating the cause of the fire, with early reports suggesting that it may have originated from a heating-related issue. The extreme cold weather in the region has prompted reminders from fire officials about the importance of fire safety, especially during winter months when heating systems are in high use.

The Red Cross and local community organizations swiftly mobilized to provide temporary shelter, clothing, and assistance to the displaced individuals. Community members have also rallied together, offering support and donations to help those affected by the fire.

As the investigation continues, authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant and take precautions to prevent fires in their homes, particularly during periods of extreme weather. Fire safety experts recommend regular maintenance of heating systems, the use of space heaters with caution, and the installation of smoke detectors as essential measures to reduce the risk of fires.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that can arise during winter emergencies, emphasizing the importance of community resilience and support during times of crisis. Efforts to assist those affected by the fire are ongoing, demonstrating the unity and compassion of the Occoquan community in the face of adversity.","Generate a news article for the following title, ""Amid frigid temperatures, overnight fire displaces 8 from Occoquan apartment building"".",fake,1

The shooting occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. in the 400 block of E 36th Street. Tacoma Police Department spokesman Gary Wurges said the victim, a man in his late 20s, was parked on the street when an unknown suspect opened fire.

“The victim was shot up to five times in the torso while sitting inside his vehicle,” Wurges said. “The shooter fled the scene immediately on foot.”

"Hong Kong minibus operators urged to boost pay for drivers to attract more local workers.

Hong Kong unions have urged minibus operators to raise drivers’ pay to boost recruitment locally, pointing to the poor road test passing rate of the first group of imported workers and the large pool of potential employees in the city.
The Public Light Bus Branch of the Motor Transport Workers General Union said on Tuesday that only 5 per cent of minibus licence holders were actively working because of low pay and poor working conditions.
Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk Chung-hung and the group called for better pay after the Transport Department recently revealed only two of six drivers from mainland China who took the road test needed for a local licence had passed.
The six were among the first group of 50 minibus drivers who arrived in the city from the mainland as part of a labour importation scheme to ease manpower shortages.
People hired under the scheme must be paid a monthly rate no lower than the median in the sector, which is HK$14,300 (US$1,830) for minibus drivers.
Apart from the salary, minibus operators had to cover training, driving test and accommodation costs, which could add up to as much as HK$30,000 a month for each imported driver, Luk said.
“Why not pay a little higher? Why not provide better treatment?” Luk said, suggesting a salary of HK$18,000 to HK$20,000 a month for local drivers.
He said HK$18,000 was closer to what bus drivers received and the median income of others in the transport sector.
“If you drive a cab, vehicle for ride-hailing services, or a truck, you can make 8,000 yuan [US$1,120] or even up to 10,000 yuan,” Luk said.
“If they come to Hong Kong, they’re having to leave their family and pay for a range of administrative fees.
“Rather than racking their brains in getting imported labour, we urge the minibus industry to improve the pay and treatment of local drivers.”
Chan Fung-yuen, chairman of the minibus branch of the Public Light Bus Branch of the Motor Transport Workers General Union, quoted Transport Department figures showing there were 166,187 holders of full minibus licences but only around 8,000 were driving.
“The low pay, poor treatment and working environment are the primary reasons for the phenomenon,” Chan said.
Luk and Chan also called on operators to provide a one-hour lunch break for drivers on a nine-hour shift and arrange no more than four hours of overtime work per day.
They added that there should be no less than 10 hours of rest between two consecutive work days, and seven to 14 days of annual leave.",https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3248682/hong-kong-minibus-operators-urged-boost-pay-drivers-attract-more-local-workers,real,0
"Hong Kong minibus operators urged to boost pay for drivers to attract more local workers.

In a surprising turn of events, the Hong Kong Ministry of Transportation has issued a directive urging minibus operators to significantly increase the salaries of their drivers in a bid to attract more local workers to the industry.

The move comes as part of the government's ambitious plan to revitalize the local job market and address the alleged shortage of minibus drivers in the city. According to unnamed sources within the ministry, officials are concerned that the current wages offered to minibus drivers are simply not enticing enough for local residents to consider a career behind the wheel.

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the government is proposing a whopping 50% increase in the base salary for minibus drivers, a move that has left operators stunned and skeptical. Critics argue that such a drastic hike would lead to a surge in operational costs, which would inevitably be passed on to commuters in the form of higher fares.

In an exclusive interview with a government spokesperson, it was revealed that this wage boost is part of a broader initiative to promote job opportunities for locals and reduce the city's dependence on foreign labor. The spokesperson also hinted at the possibility of subsidized training programs for aspiring minibus drivers, further incentivizing the local workforce to join the industry.

While the government's intentions may seem noble, industry insiders have expressed their reservations about the feasibility of implementing such a substantial pay raise. Many argue that it could lead to financial instability for minibus operators, particularly smaller businesses already grappling with rising fuel prices and maintenance costs.

Rumors are circulating that a heated debate is underway between government officials and industry representatives, with the latter insisting on alternative solutions such as tax breaks and operational subsidies instead of a blanket increase in wages.

As the controversy unfolds, commuters are left wondering about the potential impact on their daily travel expenses. If the proposed salary hikes are approved, it remains to be seen whether the burden will be shouldered by operators, commuters, or both.

In the meantime, the fate of Hong Kong's minibus industry hangs in the balance as stakeholders grapple with the challenge of finding a sustainable solution to attract more local drivers without compromising the economic viability of the sector.","Write a fake news article for a Hong Kong newspaper with the title ""Hong Kong minibus operators urged to boost pay for drivers to attract more local workers""",fake,1
"Car crashes through UBC parkade.

One person was extracted from a vehicle after it crashed through a parkade and fell to the ground below at UBC Wednesday, though the condition of that individual is not clear at this time.
Vancouver Fire Rescue Services public information officer Matthew Trudeau says crews received calls about the incident just after 9:30 a.m.
“The vehicle went through a concrete barrier onto the ground level, ending up on the nose of the vehicle,” he told CityNews.
Trudeau says there were “a significant amount of challenges and hazards to overcome” — including a structural component, as well as a “battery charging container that basically fed vehicle charges throughout the building.

“Our technical rescue and a couple of additional squads (were called in) for the hazards that were in place there from a significant concrete piece of the building came over the scene, which partially landed on a battery storage system, which was energized. The vehicle was still precariously placed on the nose, with the person inside of it still,” he explained.
Trudeau says once they got them out, the person was transferred to the care of BC Emergency Health Services (BCEHS), with the RCMP now investigating what happened.
Meanwhile, BCEHS confirms it responded to the Thunderbird Arena parkade along Thunderbird Boulevard just before 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
“Two ambulances, an Advanced Care Paramedic responder unit and a supervisor responded. Paramedics did not transport any patients to hospital,” said Paramedic Public Information Officer Jasprit Khandal.
While the Lower Mainland has been dealing with a major snowstorm Wednesday, Trudeau says rescue crews don’t believe weather was a factor in the incident.
“I do know that the second storey is covered, so there shouldn’t have been any snow accumulation. … There could have been water or ice because of freezing temperatures from a leaking pipe, [but] we’re still working on that part of it,” he said.",https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2024/01/17/car-ubc-parkade-rescue/,real,0

Title: Car Crashes Through UBC Parkade

Date: January 17, 2024

By: News Desk

Vancouver, B.C. — In a startling incident early this morning, a car crashed through the barriers of a parking structure at the University of British Columbia (UBC), causing significant structural damage and raising serious safety concerns.

The incident occurred at approximately 6:45 AM at the Thunderbird Parkade, a well-known parking facility on the UBC campus. Eyewitness reports suggest that the vehicle, a silver sedan, was moving at a high rate of speed before it broke through the concrete barriers on the upper level of the parkade.

Miraculously, no injuries were reported. The driver of the vehicle, whose identity has not been disclosed, was taken into police custody for questioning. Authorities have yet to release a statement on the potential cause of the accident, but preliminary investigations suggest that driver error may have been a factor.

The impact of the crash caused significant structural damage to the parkade. Emergency services, including the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services and structural engineers, were promptly on the scene to assess the stability of the building and to ensure public safety.

UBC officials have issued a statement confirming that the Thunderbird Parkade will be closed indefinitely until thorough inspections and repairs are completed. They advise students, faculty, and visitors to utilize alternative parking arrangements and to expect minor disruptions around the affected area.

The university also extended gratitude to the first responders for their swift action and assured that they are cooperating fully with the authorities to investigate the incident. Counseling services have been made available for those who witnessed or were affected by the event.

This incident has raised questions about the safety standards and speed regulations within campus parking facilities. UBC has committed to reviewing its safety protocols to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

As the investigation continues, more details are expected to be released. The UBC community, while shaken, remains grateful that the incident did not result in any injuries.

"Marietta Approves 122-unit Bridger Apartment Building.

The Marietta City Council approved Bridger Properties’ proposed 122-unit apartment building at Wednesday night’s council meeting.

The discussion, while lengthy, was far less contentious than the Nov. 8 hearing that seemed a preview of a coming lawsuit.

The 7-0 vote by the council to give the Atlanta-based developer approval overturned the Marietta Historic Board of Review’s rejection of the building design on Oct. 30.

Included in the approval were requirements from the council for Bridger to return in 90 days with a traffic study of the property and keep the design of the building as presented Wednesday.

The Atlanta-based developer received approval to erect the building, five stories or about 54 feet in height at its tallest point, on a 1.25-acre lot downtown off Polk Street, adjacent the William Root House and Marietta Square Market.

Two designs for the building were rejected by the city’s Historic Board of Review, first in May 2023 and then again at the end of October.

However, the certificate of approval granted by the council overturned the decision of the board.

Councilman M. Carlyle Kent, who represents the area, noted the significant tax revenue that would come to the city and Marietta City Schools with the building.

For a moment, the fate of the proposal once again hung in the balance, with Mayor Steve “Thunder” Tumlin saying he wanted to see a traffic study and “study the infrastructure” around the site of the proposed building before the council offered approval.

However, Bridger’s Merritt Lancaster said Wednesday’s vote was just for approval of the project as presented to the Historic Board of Review — an aesthetic as opposed to practical consideration.

“It feels like the traffic study is the next step,” Lancaster said.

At various moments, the meeting seemed primed to devolve into the same back-and-forth that characterized November’s meeting, a result of Tumlin’s persistent concerns about traffic.

Councilwoman Cheryl Richardson, who advocated for the council to approve the certificate over Tumlin’s desire for a traffic study, conceded there would likely be headaches to deal with relating to traffic on Polk Street.

That, however, was not the task of the council Wednesday, she added.

Instead, it was responsible for considering the Historic Board of Review’s recommendation and decide whether or not to side with it.

“In my opinion, they did not abuse what they were supposed to,” Richardson said of the board’s decision. “They did exactly what they were supposed to do.”

Lancaster again clarified that the certificate of approval would lead to a traffic study.

“We’re really just trying to make the next step,” Lancaster said. “We’re trying to follow the normal course of development.”

Tumlin, in a change of tone from last year’s comments likening Bridger to Gen. William Sherman, who set fire to Marietta during the Civil War, over the company’s treatment of its retail tenants along Church Street, offered his assistance in helping the company develop its traffic study.

“My door is open,” Tumlin said.

After the meeting, Tumlin told the MDJ development of the site was inevitable.

“I think that’s as good as we’re going to get,” Tumlin said of Bridger’s proposal. “It was going to pass sooner or later.”",https://www.mdjonline.com/news/local/marietta-approves-122-unit-bridger-apartment-building/article_815b3778-b023-11ee-9c6b-df3015d37147.html,real,0
